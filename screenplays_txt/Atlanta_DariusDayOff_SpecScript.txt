We close in on DARIUS (30)  taking a shit. He flips through
the pages of a local newspaper and smiles when he comes
across a particular article. ALFRED (35)  walks in.
ALFRED
Oh, my bad.
Alfred covers his nose and starts to back out.
DARIUS
Yooo.
Alfred stops.
DARIUS (cont'd)
I just read that weed might become
legalized statewide.
ALFRED
And? I smoke that shit either way.
DARIUS
Yea, but--
Darius folds the paper and shows the article to Alfred.
DARIUS (cont'd)
With weed legalized, crime would
decrease and the economy would grow.
Plus, there'd be a lot less black
folk in prison.
Alfred face is unchanged.
ALFRED
And we'd be unemployed.
DARIUS
Not necessarily. We could grow our
own stuff. Open up our own business.
We'd make a lot of money.
Alfred curls up his nose and turns to leave.
DARIUS (cont'd)
Aye, Al.
ALFRED
What nigga?!DARIUS
Can you get me a roll of tissue?
Alfred steps out. He comes back with a roll of tissue paper
and throws it to Darius.
DARIUS (cont'd)
Thank you good sir.
Alfred leaves. Darius wipes and flushes. He washes his hands
and brushes his teeth while scrolling through Instagram.
Afterwards, he sprays the entire place with air freshener
and slams the door.
INT. GLENWOOD APARTMENTS/KITCHEN - DAY
Darius cracks some eggs and bacon into a sizzling pan. He
puts two slices of bread into the toaster and dances to
smooth jazz which plays in the background. He pours himself
a bowl of Coconut Crunch-O's cereal and orange juice.
Minutes later, he places a greasy egg and bacon sandwich on
his plate.
ALFRED
Damn nigga, you goin feed the
homeless too?
DARIUS
Ha ha, nah. Just tryna start my
morning off right. After all,
Breakfast is the most important meal
of the day. I got my protein, carbs,
and vitamin C.
Alfred examine the breakfast sandwich intently.
ALFRED
Aye let me get a piece though.
Darius cuts the sandwich in two with a knife and gives
Alfred half. Alfred bites into it and cleans his mouth with
a napkin.
ALFRED (cont'd)
Damn.
Alfred licks his hand.
ALFRED (cont'd)
OK Chef Curry.2.Darius smiles and bites into his sandwich.
ALFRED (cont'd)
What you got plan today man?
Darius puts his hand over his mouth.
DARIUS
mouthful( )
Nothing much. I just wanna meet up
with a friend of mine. He's giving me
this limited edition Rap Vinyl.
ALFRED
Oh, okay. Sounds cool.
DARIUS
Yea but before then. I got some other
shit I gotta take care of.
Darius finishes his sandwich and drinks some OJ.
DARIUS (cont'd)
How about you?
ALFRED
Oh, I just gotta cash this check
before the bank close.
DARIUS
You should cash at this bank called
Broadway Bank, its a black-owned
bank. Good for the community.
Alfred gives it a thought.
ALFRED
Ight. What's the address? 
Darius writes the address on a piece of paper and hands it
to him. Alfred reads it and puts the piece of paper in his
pocket.
ALFRED (cont'd)
Cool.
Alfred gets up.
ALFRED (cont'd)
Thanks for the sandwich. Peace D!3.Darius throws up the peace sign and Alfred opens the door
and leaves. Darius grabs his bowl of cereal and the remote
on the counter

DARIUS (cont'd)

Darius lights a joint. He releases a puff and relaxes his
head on the couch.
DARIUS (cont'd)
Ahhhhhh.
He closes his eyes. BOOM! Darius' whole body flinches and he
almost drops his joint.
DARIUS (cont'd)
What the . . . ?
Darius takes a few more puffs and puts the joint on the
table. He grabs his pistol and peeks through the blinders.

We find a black sedan crashed into a stop sign post. Darius
cautiously walks towards the car.

Aye! You alright?4.The front of the car is smashed and smoking. Several people
come out to look. One man snaps a photo, while another takes
a video. Darius tries to help a MOM (25)  out of the driver
seat.
MOM
Forget about me. My kids are in the
back!
Darius helps her kids, one Girl (7) and one Boy (5)  and
unbuckles their seat belts.
DARIUS
Come on out little people.
The kids cough but seem unfazed. The mom stumbles out and
hugs her kids tightly.
MOM
See didn't I tell you? God is good!
He saved us from that car crash!
Darius takes a step back and squints his brows. He looks
back and forth between the car and the Mom.
DARIUS
Wait. What?
Just a few blocks away are the sounds of sirens. Darius
looks at the kids. He rubs there shoulders sympathetically.
DARIUS (cont'd)
to the Mom( )
I'm not particularly fond of the
christian holy book but I'm pretty
sure it states not to test God.
Three police cars pull up.
DARIUS (cont'd)
Wow. They usually don't come that
quick in this area.
Minutes Pass.
Darius speaks to one of the police officers. Not to far from
him, the Mom, whose now in handcuffs, speaks to another
officer.
MOM
Just check my Facebook. It'll explain
everything that happened.5.POLICE OFFICER 1
Are you serious?
Mom stays quiet. The officer tells another cop to check the
Mom's Facebook page. Moments later.
POLICE OFFICER 2
Nothing.
Police Officer 1 turns towards the Mom like now what?
MOM
I just wanted to prove to them that
God is real and he would protect
them!
POLICE OFFICER 1
OK.
Police Officer 2 pulls the kids aside.
POLICE OFFICER 1 (cont'd)
gently( )
Did your Mom really do it on purpose?
GIRL
Yeah. She told us to buckle our seat
belts and then she started going
fast. Her eyes was closed and she way
saying blah, blah, blah and 'I love
God.'
BOY
She wanted us to know that God is
real.
Police Officer 3 sighs and turns toward Darius.
