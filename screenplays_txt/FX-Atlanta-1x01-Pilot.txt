TITLES: PRINCETON UNIVERSITY - 2006
INT. OFFICE - DAY We are close on EARNEST MARKS’  face.  He looks tired and 
stressed.  His face is tight.  His eyes are glassy with 
exhaustion, probably.  He looks struck by something.  That feeling of “is this happening to me?” that people get when something unimaginable happens, good or bad. He looks down as the DEAN speaks.
DEAN (O.S.)
Mr. Marks..?
Earnest doesn’t move.
DEAN (CONT’D)
I really can’t stress the severity of this situation enough.  Full scholarships from Princeton are few and far between and in light of what’s happened, you’re lucky you aren’t in jail...Mr. Marks?  
Nothing.
DEAN (CONT’D)
You’re obviously a very bright young man. The accusations against you aren’t light.  And it would behoove you to be a little more cooperative.  Everyone else seems to have made up their minds and I’m trying to get a full picture.  Now, please start from the beginning. 
Another nothing.  The dean is getting impatient.
DEAN (CONT’D)
For the past thirty minutes you’ve said a total of five words to me: two yeses and an “I don’t know” to be precise. The door’s closing on hearing your side of the story.   What you have to say for yourself.
Earnest quickly breathes in deep.  Everything shifts to Earnest as he stares at the dean. Everyone in the room 
freezes.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyEARN
I woke up.
Silence.
EARN (CONT’D)
That’s it.
Papers rustle, zippers yelp, etc.  We can hear the dean 
starting to pack up his things.
DEAN (O.S.)
Johanna, please note Mr. Marks refused testimony.  Make sure his RA is made aware of his exit. Also, Call Mr. Suen and let him know I’m twenty minutes away.
We see the dean leave as Earnest sits there.  We never see his face.
JOHANNA
This way, Mr. Marks.
He doesn’t move.  Two police officers walk into the doorway.
JOHANNA (CONT’D)

TITLE: ATLANTA
[“BOBBY JOHNSON” BY QUE STARTS HARD AS “ATLANTA” COMES UP.]
EXT. ATLANTA - DAYBREAK
The sun is rising over Atlanta.  It’s a hot day.  Already in 
the seventies. You can see kids walking to school and a car with heavy bass cruise by.  Birds.  It’s a really pretty spring day.
INT. EASTLAKE APARTMENTS - DAY
“Emmit Smith” is still playing in the background.  The 
neighbors have it on repeat.  It’s all bass. Middle of the scene is switches to “Danny Glover” by Young Thug.
EARNEST (27) is in bed and staring at the ceiling as his 
girlfriend VAN (25) sleeps in the fetal position next to him.  2.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyVan starts to move.  She turns over and hits him in the face.  
He keeps staring.  
VAN
(eyes still closed)
What’d you dream?
EARN
A new one.
She lifts her head up sleepily.  Kinda excited.
VAN
What happened?
EARN
I was swimming in a pool, but it was like the ocean.  And I was swimming through the seaweed, but it was people’s hands instead of seaweed.  And this girl was swimming with me and told me to swim above the hands cause if they grab you they drown you-
VAN
Who’s the girl?
EARN
I dunno.
VAN
What she look like?
He thinks.
EARN
She was fat and not very interesting.
VAN
...okay.
EARN
Then we get out of the pool.  And it was behind this big house and the house had these creepy statues in it.  They all looked scared.  So I just sat down and looked at the ground.
VAN
Hm.3.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyEARN
Then the house caught on fire.  And 
we kissed.
VAN
The girl?
EARN
Yeah.
Silence.
VAN
Hm.
EARN
Jealous?
VAN
No.  Disappointed.
EARN
She’s not real.
VAN
No, I’m disappointed in the story. I thought you said she was fat and annoying.  Then you’re making out with her?
EARN
In the dream I wasn’t super handsome, so this was the best I could pull.
VAN
I hate everything that just happened here.
She turns to get out of bed.  He pulls her back and kisses her.
VAN (CONT’D)
My morning breath.
He smells it. Hard.  From her mouth.
EARN
(eyebrow raised)
Ahhh “the devil’s perfume”.
VAN
(laughing)
What is wrong with you?!4.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyEARN
They don’t know.
They start to kiss.  Heavy.  Stuff is happening beneath the 
covers.  He starts kissing her neck and she breathes out heavy.  He did something that she’s down with.  He continues.
VAN
(exhale)
Say you love me.
Earn chuckles a bit.  Then, she stops him.
EARN
Wha?
VAN
Why’d you laugh?
EARN
Cause you always ask me that.  And I’m like “of course”.
VAN
Then just say “I love you”.
EARN
I love you.
A moment.  She gets out of bed.  She’s not pissed, it’s just that the mood is wrong now.  She walks in the bathroom.  
VAN (O.C.)
(from the bathroom)
You remember you have Lottie tonight, right?
He did not.
EARN
Of course.
VAN
I have parent-teacher tonight.  I can’t have her.
EARN
I got her. After work.
VAN
You’re still working at the airport?5.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyEARN
I just still show up.  They haven’t 
noticed I’m not working.  
VAN
If you’re gonna stay here, I need your help with the rent, Earn.
EARN
You’ll have my half tonight. 
She dips back in the bathroom.
EARN (CONT’D)
What time are you coming back?
VAN
Prob around eleven.
EARN
That’s late.  Taking the parents to Magic City afterward? Follies?
VAN
I have a date.
Silence.  She planned that.  But you can’t tell if this is a tactic to get Earn to react or if she’s actually over him and just being mean to him while he stays with her.  He tries to come up with something to show he’s cool with it...but he fails.  He just gets out of bed instead.
INT. LOTTIE’S NURSERY - DAY
Earn comes in and sees LOTTIE (1) is already awake in her 
crib.
EARN
Look who’s already awake!
He picks her up and kisses her.
EARN (CONT’D)
You’re with me tonight.  Mommy’s 
going on a date with some dude.
(baby talk)
Fuck this dude, right?
There’s a part of “Danny Glover” that reminds me of baby talk (2:03).  He does it in sync to the baby.  She laughs.6.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyINT. MARTA TRAIN - DAY 
*This is all one shot until Earn gets to the top of the 
stairs.Earn is listening to music on some headphones.  He’s got the 
whole section to himself, so his feet are up on the seats.  Listening to “Brad Jordan” by Isaiah Rashad, Earn bobs his head. You can only hear the song.
A GIRL sitting on the train is eating hot fries and staring 
out the window.  A girl in a HEAD WRAP walks on from a 
different car.  A DUDE is closely following Head Wrap.  He’s trying to get her back to the other car.  Head Wrap is pissed.  She screams at the other girl.  The other girl has a “get this hoe out my face” demeanor. Earn watches quietly.
It starts to get physical. Earn’s had enough.  He gets up and 
solemnly walks onto the next car.  But you can still see them arguing through the window behind him.  Earn’s back is to them, so he doesn’t see what we see.  The Hot Fries girl pushes Head Wrap hard into her seat.  Head Wrap falls into the seat behind her.  She’s livid now.
Head Wrap pulls out a gun.BANG.Earn drops on the floor of the car.  We can hear everything 
now, his earphones are off.  He’s pulled off his earphones.  Head Wrap has shot Hot Fries and has turned to the dude she ran in with.  His hands are up.  They are yelling at each other.
DUDE
Bitch, what’s wrong wit you?!  You betta gimmie that muthafuckin gun for- 
She shoots him.
The train has stopped and people start running off.  Earn 
runs off and up the stairs away from the commotion.  He stands with some kids off to the side and watch as police and security run in.  Head Wrap yells as GUNSHOTS go off.  They shoot her.
Earn stands there watching.  Three cops step off the train.  
They congratulate each other (high fives, hugs, etc.).  A local news crew has somehow already set up.  They interview one of the cops for what seems to be three seconds.  They shake hands, and everyone leaves.  7.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyThe kids filmed all this on their phones.  They kinda chuckle 
and walk off after the commotion.
KIDS
Fuck/Daaammmn, homie/ Shit was crazy shawt. 
The bloody bodies lie on the train still.  The train starts up again and leaves.  Earn stares.
INT. HARTSFIELD AIRPORT - CREDIT CARD STAND - DAY
Earn and SWIFF (27) stand next to their station.  They’re 
both in a blue blazer and ties.  Swiff is looking at his phone.  The banner above their station says “DELTA SKYMILES: FREE TRIP ANYWHERE WITH SIGN UP!”  There’s a heavyset older black woman, LORETTA (54?), wearing the same tie and blue blazer.  Loretta looks like a sweet old grandma type.  She’s speaking with this older white guy.  He’s filling out a form.
Earn sees a dude rushing past.  He tries him.
EARN
Excuse me, sir-
A DUDE
Fuck off.
EARN
I know, right?
Earn steps back with Swiff. 
SWIFF
We shut Compound 
down, my nigga.  
Me and my cousin had like eight 
bottles in dat bitch.  Lef out with like, three hoes.  Each, my nigga.  And we was supposed to hit two-dollar Tuesdays at Ultimate, but he had to see his P.O. back in Florida on Monday.  I’ma go anyway.  You wanna come?  
Earn stares off, lost.  Swiff vines himself.
SWIFF (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(filming)
Bitch niggas be like.
Swiff turns the phone on Earn.8.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlySWIFF (CONT’D)
Hey, Earn.  Say something.
Earn slowly turns to camera.  Holding his scowl the entire 
time.  
SWIFF (CONT’D)
Perfect.
The Vine video on his phone now has Swiff saying “Bitch niggas be like”  then Earn slowly turning to camera.
EARN
Van’s dating other guys, Swiff.  She’s gonna kick me out.  I’m broke.  And I can’t sign anyone up cause I’m not an old lady. 
SWIFF
You can’t sign anyone up because you refuse to lie to people.   You better stop letting niggas walk over you and get this money.
Loretta is talking to a white UGA student looking kid with glasses.
LORETTA
You look 
just like my little 
nephew, baby.  That’s a sign.  You supposed to sign up for me.
STUDENT
This’ll get me a free flight anywhere?
LORETTA
Yeah, baby!  And I’ll give you an extra flight too.  But only if you promise to keep flirting with me.
STUDENT
Oh Loretta, stop.
She tickles him playfully.  The student laughs, flustered.
SWIFF
This bitch is amazing. 
Loretta stands behind the student’s back while he fills out the form.  She then turns to Swiff and Earn and silently pretends to fuck the student in the ass.  Tongue out, “rocker” fist up.  Earn and Swiff stare.9.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlySWIFF (CONT’D)
Fuckin crazy. I’d still smash.
(then)
You listen to that Paper Boy yet?  
Shit is good.
EARN
(not looking)
Who?
SWIFF
Paper Boy? “I got that paper, boy”? He got that mixtape coming out Friday. Supposed to be hot.
Swiff plays Earn a video called “Paper Boy”, by the artist Paper Boy:
The video starts outside of the EASTLAKE APARTMENTS.  There’s 
a group of men bouncing to the beat.  Some hold stacks of cash, some smoke blunts:
PAPER BOY
PAPER BOY/ ALL ABOUT MY PAPER, BOY/ GOT MY TEAM TO SERVE A FIEND FROM CALI TO DECATUR, BOY. 
Paper Boy raps in a basement as men with their faces covered by white masks stir pots filled with a powdery/soupy mix. They show the mix to camera.  
PAPER BOY (CONT’D)
PAPER BOY/ LAME, YOU JUST A HATER BOY/ IF IT AIN’T BOUT KILOS AND THEM ZEROS, SEE YOU LATER, BOY.
Cut to: Paper Boy is on a bike riding around the neighborhood.  But instead of tossing newspapers, he’s tossing bricks of cocaine. Fiends rush out and grab the coke.  They cry with joy and mouth “thank you!” It’s pretty funny, but kinda fly too.  Earn stares at Paper Boy.
SWIFF
Tight, right?
EARN
That’s my cousin.
SWIFF
Paper Boy? Furreal? Are you guys cool?  Cause you’re gonna wanna get in there before he gets signed. 10.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyEARN
(watching the video)
He shouldn’t sign. 
SWIFF
Is this expertise from interning at 
fake record companies?
EARN
All record companies are fake.  They’re unnecessary.  What’s a record company gonna do for him that he can’t do himself?
SWIFF
Uhhhh....dat money?  I heard they already offering him like seven figures.
Earn stares.  Gears turn.  He gets a text.
EARN
Fuck. Billy.
SWIFF
Someone figured out you’re not working.
Swiff vines Earn’s face.
SWIFF (CONT’D)
(to the camera)
THIS NIGGA FIRED!  Do it for the vine!
He turns camera to Loretta.  She rams the air with her tongue out.
INT. BILLY’S OFFICE - DAY
Earn stands in front of Billy’s desk.  Billy (30),  bro-ey 
Mexican dude,  walks in from behind.  He’s the kinda guy who 
swears you’re on the same team when he’s really the enemy, but too much of a pussy to own up to being the enemy. 
BILLY
What’s up, man!
They awkwardly hug. Then it kinda transitions into Billy giving Earn a weird shoulder massage.11.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyBILLY (CONT’D)
What ever happened to me, you, and 
the baby mama’s getting weekend drinks man?
EARN
I work a double shift here on Saturdays.
BILLY
Grindin’.  Me too.  Tryin to get this bonusssss.  Gotta put that Ace Hood on repeat.
For a moment he plays “Huslte Hard” by Ace Hood on his shitty Best Buy speakers. 
EARN
We’re not allowed to listen to music on the floor.
BILLY
(faux anger)
That’s right!  And I better not catch you!
Billy laughs then mouths “I don’t care”.
BILLY (CONT’D)
Ey, you seen this?  Shit is wild.
Billy sits at his desk and plays a Video on Worldstar.  Earn walks over and looks.  It’s video of the shooting on MARTA.
EARN
(walking away)
I’ve seen it.
BILLY
Crazy, right?
EARN
Not really.  Why’d you call me in?
BILLY
Right. Well, I’m gonna be honest man.  Your sign ups haven’t been getting approved. You gotta approach people you feel will more than likely be approved.
EARN
Profiling.12.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyBILLY
Profiling?! No, no, no.  United 
American Credit does not support discrimination of a person based on outward appearance in any way, shape, or form.
EARN
That’s 
exactly what you’re asking 
me to do.
BILLY
No, I’m asking you to get your approvals up.  Loretta doesn’t profile.  And she’s killing it.  Been killing it.
We see a wall of photos of Loretta winning “Best Seller” since like...1994. She’s gone through two other managers.  Earn notices the very first photo on the wall is in black and white and from 1959.  Two white men shake hands. Loretta is in the background, but by her dress it seems as if she’s one of their servants. She’s staring at them very creepily.  She looks the 
exact same age.
EARN
(to himself)
The fuck?
BILLY
I know.  Black don’t crack, right?  Have to be honest dude.  We’re gonna have to let you go if these numbers can’t move.  Think you can do it without profiling?  I think you can.
Earn just stares.
BILLY (CONT’D)
Alright.  I’m gonna need your login password for your company email.
EARN
Fuck you, Billy.
BILLY
(picking up the phone)
Okay.  We can skip right to security-
EARN
No.  That’s my password.  “Fuck you Billy”. 13.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyBilly looks at him.  Then types something into the computer. 
A moment.  Then looks up with an approving nod.
EXT. GLORIA AND RILEY’S HOME - DAY
Earn knocks on a door.  An older man, Earnest’s dad RILEY 
(55) opens the door, but doesn’t open the gate in front of the door.
RILEY
Son.
EARN
Hey dad.  Where’s mom?
Earnest’s mom GLORIA (50) sits in the back on the couch.  
GLORIA
Hey Earn.
EARN
Hey mom.  How are you?
RILEY
Good.  How are you, Earn?
EARN
Good.
RILEY
Good.
They silently nod at each other for too long.
EARN
You gonna invite me in?
RILEY
(laughing)
No.
EARN
Why?
RILEY
I can’t afford it.
EARN
Come on, you think I’m here for money?
A knowing silence.14.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyGLORIA
We do.  Yes.
EARN
I came here to find Alfred.  And to 
know if you could hold Lottie tonight for a bit.  I got some business...and her mom’s going on a date.
GLORIA
Really?  Good for Van.  Glad she’s moving on.
EARN
You do know that I’m Lottie’s father and your son, right?
GLORIA
I’m team Van.  You had your  chance.
RILEY
When you were describing yourself you forgot “eats all our food” and “raises my internet bill like I ain’t supposed to notice”. 
EARN
Number one: Mrs. Daniels shouldn’t have a key to this house.  I told you that. I’m gonna use her Alzheimer’s to my advantage. 
RILEY
That’s wrong, boy.GLORIA
(horrified)
Jesus in heaven.
EARN (CONT’D)
Number two: I’m in and out.  You barely notice I was here.
RILEY
Nigga, you ain’t a ninja.  There was a turd the size my fuckin head waiting for me when I got home.  You supposed to be a genius, you can’t remember to flush?
GLORIA
You leave droppings.  Like a bear.  I took a look.  You better eat something real.  15.
(MORE)TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyInstead of all them candies and 
cookies and whatever other stuff was in there.
EARN
Did you break it up with a stick or something?  What’s wrong with you?
RILEY
Alfred’s in the Glenwood apartments.  At least that’s where we helped him move in last.  Offered him your room, but you know Al. Didn’t want help.
EARN
I’m trying to help him.
RILEY
Tends to be the other way around.
As they talk, neighbors pull in to their driveway playing “Paper Boy” from their car.
EARN
Things change.
RILEY
No they don’t.
GLORIA
(out the door)
TURN IT THE FUCK DOWN.
RILEY
(re: Gloria)
Exhibit A.  
EARN
Alfred made this song, by the way.
GLORIA
Well tell him to turn it down.
EARN
Not how it works, but I’ll let him know.  Lottie needs to be picked up at three.
RILEY
From where?16.
GLORIA (CONT'D)TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyEARN
Why don’t you have mom ask Van.  
Since they’re such good frie-
GLORIA
Van just texted where to go.  We’re good.
RILEY
We’re good.
Earnest nods and heads out.
INT. GLENWOOD APARTMENTS - DAY
ALFRED (35) is playing video games on the couch.  DARIUS (30) 
is in the refrigerator scavenging.  He’s got on an apron and 
is making cookies.  Darius holds a carton of milk.
DARIUS
Is this milk bad?
ALFRED
(staring ahead)
What are you using it for?
DARIUS
Drinking.
ALFRED
Yeah, it’s bad.
KNOCK at the door.  Alfred and Darius look at each other.   Alfred grabs a forty-five from under the sofa seat.  Cocks it.  Darius ties the towel he was holding around his mouth like a bandit, then holds a pan in attack mode.
Alfred slowly opens the door.  It’s Earnest.
ALFRED (CONT’D)
Earn.
EARN
Wasup Al.  
It’s all awkwardness. The pause where the hug should be is 
enough.  Earn spots the gun.
EARN (CONT’D)
You knew I was coming?
Alfred opens the door.  Earnest walks in and sees Darius standing there, ready to attack.17.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyALFRED
That’s Darius.
Earnest nods.  Darius nods.  Earnest walks in and looks 
around.
EARN
Nice place.
ALFRED
No it’s not.
Darius comes over with a plate of cookies.  Earnest takes one.
EARN
Thanks.  All I had was some chips for breakfast.
DARIUS
Something to drink?
EARN
Milk, I guess?
Darius looks at Alfred.  Alfred nods like “I guess give it to em”. Darius goes.
EARN (CONT’D)
So how’s it been-
ALFRED
Fuck you want, man.
EARN
Why does everyone think I want something?
ALFRED
Everybody wants something.  People aren’t nice.  Even when they are, that’s just the long version of wanting something.
Darius gives Earnest the glass of milk.  While Alfred is talking, he tries to dunk the cookie in the milk. The cookie sticks in the milk, as if it was mud.  He puts it down.
ALFRED (CONT’D)
Rich people don’t 
like me.  They’re 
nice to me cause I’m the doorman and have complete access to the building when it’s time to rob them. 18.
(MORE)TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyWhen was the last time you were 
nice to a girl you weren’t trying to fuck?
EARN
This morni-
ALFRED
And wasn’t over sixty.
Earnest gives up.  He’s right.
DARIUS
Your cutoff is Sixty? That’s the good pussy.
EARN
Okay.  What do you do, Darius?
DARIUS
Just slather it with KY mostly.
EARN
Okay, gross.  I meant your job.
Darius thinks about it.
DARIUS
You know what...me too.
They stare at each other for a moment.
EARN
I feel as though our relationship will be me not understanding what you say.
DARIUS
(smiling, like they 
figured it out)
Yeah.
EARN
So...”Paper Boy”.  The hood anthem.
ALFRED
You know.  Trying to get this money.  Eating.
EARN
Yeah.  Me too.19.

By doing what? Getting kicked out 
of Princeton?
Earnest looks up.
ALFRED (CONT’D)
Yeah.  I know what happened- 
EARN
No you don’t.
Earn’s whole demeanor changes. There’s a weird stand off.
EARN (CONT’D)
Can we talk somewhere, cause-
(gesture to Darius)
Who is this guy?
ALFRED
I’m fine with talking here.DARIUS
I’m Darius.
Darius quietly walks over to Earn, concerned.
DARIUS
(honestly confused)
...we met over by the door when you first walked in-
EARN
I know who you are.
(to Alfred)
I’m not asking for money.  I wanna be your manager.  I can help.
ALFRED
How are 
you gonna help me?  Aren’t 
you homeless.
EARN
Not real homeless.   I’m not walking around using a rat as a phone or anything.
ALFRED
Well, that wouldn’t make you homeless.  That’d make you crazy.
DARIUS
Not if it worked.
Earn and Alfred look at him.20.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyDARIUS (CONT’D)
If you could get a rat to work as a 
phone you’d be a genius.  There’s five rats for every person in New York alone. Everyone could have an affordable phone.  
(then)
Maybe the tail’s an antenna... 
Darius thinks, then starts to draw something. Earn turns away.
EARN
Look, don’t sign a deal. 
ALFRED
I need the money.
EARN
We’ll get money.  I guarantee there’s more money in the long run.
ALFRED
What “long run”?  I’m a thirty five year old rapper who’s never been ten minutes outside the perimeter.  I’ma cash out.   
EARN
I’m not dumb.  You’re older, you have no real fanbase, you’re not white and/or selling sex. 
ALFRED
I’m selling sex.
Earn is confused.
ALFRED (CONT’D)

Track twenty-eight.
Darius plugs his phone into a shitty boombox.
BOOMBOX

Twenty eight?  Lotta skits?
ALFRED
Yeah. But it’s different.  Mine are funny.
EARN
Uh-huh.  I’d take ‘em out.
ALFRED
Good thing you’re not my manager.
EARN
I still got connects from Diamond House. Promoters. People who manage big artists now. I know what I’m doing.  
ALFRED
See, you think you’re slick.  You came in here like you’re saving me.  But really I’m saving 
you.  Again. 
EARN
I can get you on the radio.  That’s what you’re missing.
ALFRED
I’ma be real with you.  You haven’t been great.  I haven’t seen or heard from you since the funeral.  And the first thing I do hear from you is “let’s get rich!” off my work.  Usually I’m the one defending you, but I can’t do it anymore.
Alfred plops on the couch and starts playing video games again.  Earn heads for the door.  He stops.
EARN
I can get you on the radio.
Alfred continues playing video games, seemingly unaffected. Earn walks out the door.
DARIUS
You good?

He’s right, tho.  You don’t need no label yet.22.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyAlfred pauses the game.
EXT. HOT 1O7 RADIO STATION PARKING LOT - DAY
Earn anxiously waits on the side of the building. DAVE (28), 
a young white guy, exits the building and approaches 
DAVE
(excited)
My nigga! What’s good?
Dave slaps Earn on the back while Earn reacts uncomfortably.
EARN 
Hey man.
DAVE
I haven’t seen you in like two 
years.  I heard you were back.  What happened?  I thought you were Ivy league.
EARN
Yeah I was up there.  Wasn’t for me.  Did some work up north, then west coast.  Moved back two years ago.  My daughter’s here so-

Oh shit, right.  You still with that girl Van?
EARN
Yeah.  Kinda.
DAVE
She is bad.  Don’t let her out.  Niggas be lurkin.
Earn is visibly offended at this point but Dave doesn’t seem to notice or care.

Nah, but seriously y’all need to play “Paper Boy”.
DAVE
My nigga, if it were up to me?  Yeah. But you know KP picks all the music.

Five hundred dollars?  Am I buying the station?
DAVE

Dave walks back towards the entrance to the radio station. A group of black employees head toward the door at the  same 
time. DAVE engages them in small talk. EARN can slightly hear DAVE talk to the employees. DAVE’s voice is much more professional and a different pitch. Almost a surfer tone.
DAVE (CONT’D)
(To employees)
What’s up, my dudes. Whaddup bro!
Earn thinks about this. He then notices JANITOR (57) pushing 
a cart of cleaning materials nearby through the parking lot. 
EARN
(to JANITOR)
Hey.
(gesturing towards DAVE)
That guy ever called you “nigga”?
JANITOR
(condescending laugh)
Yeah right. I’d break my foot up his ass.
Janitor continues on his way.  
EXT. PIEDMONT PARK- DAY
Earn sits on a park bench, deep in thought. Then CHRIS BOSH 
MAN walks up and sits down next to him.
CHRIS BOSH MAN
Troubles?
Earn looks up.  
EARN
Yeah.25.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyCHRIS BOSH MAN
Do tell.
Chris Bosh Man is making a Nutella sandwich on his lap. It’s 
messy. 
EARN
I think I’m a loser.  I think I’m just supposed to lose.  It’s in front of me and I can see it, but I just...I’m not supposed to have it.   I can’t even be a good father.
CHRIS BOSH MAN
(looking out)
Resistance is a symptom of the way things are.  Not the way things necessarily should be. Actual victory belongs to people who simply do not accept failure. You’ve accepted your losses.  That’s why you 
feel like you’ve 
failed.
A moment. Then, slowly, the man brings the sandwich to his mouth and bites into it. Creepy.
EARN
Who are you?
Chris Bosh Man chuckles.
CHRIS BOSH MAN
Who do you think I am?
EARN
You a basketball player?
CHRIS BOSH MAN
I don’t think so.
They both sit quietly as he eats the sandwich.
CHRIS BOSH MAN (CONT’D)
Bite my sandwich.
EARN
No thanks.
His smiles fades.
CHRIS BOSH MAN
Nigga...if you don’t bite this sandwich.26.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyThere’s tension.
INT. GLORIA AND RILEY’S HOME - EVENING
Riley walks in the front door with Gloria behind him holding 
Lottie.  They’re holding Chick-Fil-a bags.  They turn on the light and find Alfred sitting on the couch with Darius and a casserole pan.
RILEY
Shit!GLORIA
Jesus in heaven.
RILEY
Boy, how’d you get in here?
ALFRED
Ms. Daniels let me in.  Gave me some lasagna. 
(lifts the pan)
Took a bite.  It’s cat food.
GLORIA
(offering her bag)
You must be starving.  Have some of this, baby.
DARIUS
What? No!
ALFRED
(to Darius)
She was calling 
me “baby”.
She was offering her food.  
Darius nods, understandng.  Riley walks in.
RILEY
So Earn found you. Ask you for money?
ALFRED
Nah.  Talked about some business. He knows I might be in some money soon.  And Darius and I were thinking there might be more if I wait.  But I wanted to make sure ya’ll were straight first.
GLORIA
You ain’t gotta worry about us.RILEY
We’re good.27.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyALFRED (CONT’D)
Does he know you’re sick?
GLORIA
Who said I was sick?
ALFRED
You just did.  You also left a 
pamphlet on the table.
RILEY
Hood Sherlock.
Alfred and Darius look at each other.  Alfred pulls out his phone and starts recording a voice memo.
ALFRED
Mixtape name: Hood Sherlock.  Instead of magnifying glass... 
(thinks, then shrugs)
Brick of coke.
DARIUS
(tries to sneak it in 
before Alfred stops recording)
Darius is Watson.
RILEY
It seems like you may have come here for me to tell you not to go for broke.
Alfred shrugs.
RILEY (CONT’D)
Earn did this with Princeton.  He’ll tell you I’m not the one.
EXT. HOT 1O7 RADIO STATION - EVENING
Dave is on air in the DJ booth.  His recording voice 
DAVE

top of the hour.  Tweet me your request.  I’m here on Atlanta’s Hip-Hop-
Earn walks in.28.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyDAVE (CONT’D)
My nigga, you came!  You look 
weird.
EARN
I just had a moment of enlightenment.  Or I just shared a sandwich with Satan.
DAVE
Lemme record this right quick.
EARN quickly places some folded money in DAVE’s hand.
EARN
That’s four hundred and thirty four dollars. Everything I have minus some bus money. Give it to KP.
DAVE
I’ll see what-
EARN
Nah.  You’ll make it happen.
KP (40s) walks in. 
KP
I’m brining Nas in right now about Birthday Bash.  Say hi when you get a minute?
DAVE
(professional)
No problem, bro.
KP leaves.
DAVE (CONT’D)
(nigga)
Look, man. I’ma try my hardest but-
EARN
That money’s not going to KP, is it?  You’re pocketing that and your gonna tell me next week KP isn’t feelin the song.  If you were serious about this, you would’ve introduced me to KP right then, but you didn’t.
DAVE

(recording voice)
This is your boy Blowout, and I got your Future tickets at the top of the hour.  Tweet me your request. I’m taking over for the Dirtty Boyz tonight right here on Atlanta’s Hip-Hop-- NIGGA! CHILL!
Earn quietly shifts his eyes.  Dave turns to the left and sees Nas and KP staring back at him.  
They can hear him in 
the studio. Earn’s hand is on the switch.  He flips it off.
EARN
(gesturing wildy)
Here’s the deal.  You’re gonna do exactly what I say.
DAVE
Why are you acting so weird?30.
DAVE (CONT'D)TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyEARN
Because I want them to think I’m 
upset about you calling me a nigga, when we both know I couldn’t care less.  I’m about money.
Dave is starting to realize he’s been played a little.
EARN (CONT’D)
(still gesturing crazy)
You’re gonna give KP that money.  You’re gonna introduce me to him when he comes in here, and you’re gonna let me let you keep your job.  You were right. Music is gross.  
Dave is a little stunned.  KP walks in.
KP
Can I talk to you for a second, Dave?
EARN
Actually, may I talk to you for a second Mr...?
KP
Parker.
Earn walks out with KP.
INT. MARTA BUS - EVENING
EARN is sitting in a seat on the bus with Lottie in his arms,  
asleep.  He has earphones on.  “Don’t Disturb This Groove” by The System is all we can hear, as if we’re Earn. Earn looks out the window solemnly while eating a Wendy’s burger with his one free hand.  Everyone on the bus looks dead. Just sad and dead.  That look after you’ve worked so hard, all day, and you don’t know why. 
He looks at his daughter, then pulls out his phone.  He 
begins to text Van. He puts “I love you.  I was wrong.  Can we talk tonight?” 
He stares at “send”. The message disappears as his phone starts ringing.  It’s 
Alfred.
EARN
(on phone)
Hello?31.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyAlfred’s voice can be heard on the other side of the phone.
ALFRED (O.C.)
Yo. You hear that, my nigga?
EARN
Hear what?
CUT TO:
INT. ALFRED’S CAR - NIGHT
Alfred and Darius are in the car parked outside of a Chinese 
restaurant. Darius is eating Lo Mein out of a box. Both are bobbing their heads. “Paper Boy” is playing from the car radio.
ALFRED
(To Darius)
Yo turn that up.
(to EARN on phone)
“Paper Boy”. They’ve been spinning this shit for the last hour. 
DARIUS
T.P.B. Bitch!  Team Paper Boy for life.
(then)
Tell em I sketched out them rat phones. 
He pulls out a sketch.  He takes a picture.
ALFRED
Darius wants to send you a sketch of the rat phone.  Okay?
EARN
Uh...yeah.  Whatever.
ALFRED
Sounds good on the radio.  Thanks.
EARN
Trying to be a man of my word.
ALFRED
I feel you.  Well maybe we can sit down and talk.  See if you got any more ideas.
EARN
Like a manager?32.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyALFRED
Like a “calm the fuck down, we’ll 
see”.
Earn smiles.  Alfred notices a GIRL off camera walk past the car.
ALFRED (CONT’D)
(to Girl)
Ey baby! That’s me they playing on the radio.
GIRL (O.S.)
So what?
ALFRED
(angrily to girl)
Well fuck you then! Stank ass broad.
DARIUS
(to girl)
You ain’t cute!  Fake ass instagram model.
ALFRED
(to EARN on phone)
Yea man, what you doing tomorrow?
EARN
Shit. I gotta try to get my job back.  I spent the last of everything I had today-
ALFRED
(to EARN)
Hold on. Something’s happening. I’ll hit to you later, cuh.

INT. MARTA BUS - EVENING
EARN
Hello?  Al?
Earnest gets a message on his phone.  It’s the rat phone diagram.  Earn laughs, then notices it’s actually really good. I mean, it’s a stupid idea, but Darius obviously has some sort of knowledge in engineering and electronics.  Earnest is shocked.33.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyINT. EASTLAKE APARTMENTS - NIGHT
Earnest lies on a couch in the living room, looking sleepy. 
He hears a key in the door and perks up. Van walks in the door and sees Earn on the couch.
VAN
Hello. Don’t tell me you waited up for me.
EARN
No.  I’m not tripping. You’re a grown woman. I’m not your keeper.
VAN flashes a faint smile at Earnest. She continues to get herself comfortable while she walks in the bedroom. Earnest follows her.
VAN
Where’s my baby? I hope you fed her.
EARN
Of course. Lottie is asleep in her crib. I’m not as irresponsible as you like to believe.
VAN
Yea, let you tell it.
Earn sits on the bed while Van changes into her pajamas.
EARN
So...how was your day? 
VAN
(smiling)
How was my date? 
EARN
Not what I said.
VAN
You’re such a hater.
Van gives Earnest a love tap to the head.  He grabs her and kisses her hard.  When he pulls away she looks at him as if he’s brand new.  She’s struck.
EARN
I know he’s a corny ass dude.  Cause he’s not me.34.TV Calling - For educational purposes onlyVan’s never really seen this.  It’s different.  Kind of a 
turn on.
VAN
Maybe. But maybe I like corny dudes. The kind that have weird dreams all the time. How was your day? 
EARN
Alright. A little long but it turned out okay I guess. 
Van motions for Earn to get in bed next to her. Earn gets up off the bed and gets under the covers next to Van.  She turns on the T.V. The news.
EARN (CONT’D)
Can you tell me how close I am?“Ey girl.  I’m not trying to fuck, I just wanna listen to Talib and vibe with your energy. Don’t mind the incense and neo-soul cd collection. CD’s because downloading music is illegal.” That right?
Van laughs. She begins to play with Earn’s hair.
T.V.
A shooting on the eastside of Atlanta tonight outside of Dragonfly Chinese restaurant on Wesley Chapel.  One man was shot and is in stable condition.  Witnesses say a fight broke out after two men cat called a woman.  One of the suspects, known as the rapper “Paper Boy,” was arrested.
Earnest turns to the television. Fuck.
VAN (O.C.)
Oh yeah.  You got that money for the rent?...Earn?
