FADE IN 
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE 
Silent and endless. 
... cold and remote. 
technology. The stars shine like the love of God 
Against them drifts a tiny chip of 
CLOSER: It is the NARCISSUS, lifeboat of the ill-fated 
star freighter Nostromo. Without interior or running 
lights it seems devoid of life. The PING of a RANGING 
RADAR grows louder, closer. A shadow engulfs the 
Narcissus. Searchlights flash on, playing over the tiny 
ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends toward it. 
INT. NARCISSUS 
Dark and dormant as a crypt. The searchlights stream in 
the dusty windows. Outside, massive metal forms CAN BE 
SEEN descending around the shuttle. Like the tolling of 
a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through the 
hull. 
CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR: Light 'glares as 
a cutting 
torch bursts through the metal, moving with machine 
precision, cutting a rectangular path. The torch cuts 
off. The door falls inward REVEALING a bizarre milti-armed 
figure. A ROBOT WELDER. 
FIGURES enter, back-lit and ominous. THREE MEN in 
bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment. They 
approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g. The 
leader's gloved hand wipes at an opaque layer of dust on 
the canopy. 
ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE; as light stabs in where the dust is 
wiped away, illuminating a WOMAN, her face in peaceful 
repose. WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY sole survivor of the 
Nostromo. Nestled next to her is JONES, 
the ship's 
wayward cat. 
LEADER 
Bio-readouts are all in the green. 
She's alive. Well, there goes our 
salvage, guys.

A86 2-A EXT. SPACE/EARTH ORBIT 
3 PANNING across the serene blue curve of Earth AS SEEN from 
high orbit onto GATEWAY STATION, a sprawling complex of 
modular orbital habitats. In f.g. a viewing portal opens 
in a vertical wall of the MEDICAL SECTION. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
Harsh sunlight fills the room as the notorized shield 
continues to rise. A FEMALE MED-TECH turns from the window 
controls. 
MED-TECH 
Watch your eyes. 
She crosses to a bed in which Ripley lies, looking wan, 
amid an array of arcane white MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. The 2 
2-A 
3 
tech exudes practiced cheeriness, but RIPLEY isn't buying it. 
RIPLEY 
When am I going to see someone 
in authority? 
MED-TECH 
So. Feeling stronger are we? 
RIPLEY 
We are tired of the runaround. Why 
won't anybody 
tell me what's going 
on? How long his it been? 
MED-TECH 
Well, you've been here at 
Gateway 
Station for three days. 
You were pretty groggy at first so --
RIPLEY 
Look, I know that part! How long 
was I in hypersleep? 
The tech glances up as the door opens o.s. She smiles, 
saved by the distraction. 
MED-TECH 
Looks like you have a visitor. 
A MAN corsses the room carrying a familiar large, 
orange TOMCAT. 
RIPLEY 
Jones! 
(CONTINUED) 3 
A86 CONTINUED: 
Ignoring the man she grabs the cat and hugs it to her. 
Jones seems none the worse for.wear and begins to purr. 
RIPLEY 
Jonesy. You ugly thing. 
The visitor sits beside the bed and Ripley finally 
notices him. He is thrityish and handsome, in a suit 
that looks executive or legal, the tie loosened with 
studied casualness. A smile referred to as 'winning.' 
MAN 
Nice room. I'm Bruke. Carter Burke. 
I work for the company, but other 
than that I'm an okay guy. Glad to 
see you're feeling better. 
Ripley's gaze turns stony. 
RIPLEY 
You're with the company? Then 
you're the last person I want 
to be talking to. 
BURKE 
(genuinely wounded) 
Why is that? 
RIPLEY 
Because I'm bringing you guys up 
on charges .•. willful negligence 
leading to the deaths ·of my crew, 
for starters. 
BURKE 
Whoaa, Ripley. That's not me. 
Those guys are gone. There've 
been some ghanges. That's 
what I came here to tell you 
about. 
RIPLEY 
How long was I out there? 
BURKE 
It's bad, kiddo. It's gonna be a 
shock. 
She grabs his arm, suprisingly strong. 
RIPLEY 
How long? 
(CONTINUED) 3 
3 3 
A86 CONTINUED: ( 2) 
BURKE 
Fifty-seven years. 
Ripley is stunned. She seems to deflate, her expression 
passing through amazement and shock to realization of all 
she has lost. Friends. Family. Her world. 
RIPLEY 
Fifty-seven ... oh, Christ ... 
BURKE 
You'd drifted right through the 
core systems. It's blind luck that 
deep-salvage team caught you when 
they did. One in a thousand. 
You're just damn lucky to be 
alive .•. 
While Burke is talking we have PUSHED IN TO A TIGHT 
CLOSEUP ON Jones, who begins to hiss and struggle in 
Ripley's arms. WE GO INTO SUBTLE SLOW MOTION. The cat 
leaps to the floor, bounding away. Ripley coughs 
suddenly, as if chiking. Her expression becomes one 
of dawning horror. Burke, unaware of what is coming, 
hands her a glass of water from the nightstand. She 
slaps it away. It shatters with a SMASH. Jones dives, 
yowling, under a cabinet. 
Ripley grabs her chest, struggling as if she is 
strangling. The med-tech hits a console button. 
MED-TECH 
(shouting) 
Code Blue! 415. Code Blue! 
4-1-5! 
Burke and the med-tech are holding Ripley's shoulders as 
she 
goes into convulsions. A DOCTOR and TWO TECHS run in. 
Ripley's back arches in agony. 
RIPLEY 
No •.• nooo ! 
They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over 
equipment. Her EKG races like mad. Joens, under the 
cabinet, hisses wide-eyed. 
DOCTOR 
Hold her, .• Get me an airway, statl 
And fifteen c.c.'s of ... Jesus! 
Ripley stares at the SHAPE RISING UNDER THE SHEET. Tearing 
itself out of her. A glimpse of the CHITTERING 
HORROR ... 
IT SCREECHES ...

RIGHT ON RIPLEY, screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME. Alone 
in 
the darkened hospital room. She gasps for breath, 
clutching pathetically at her chest. There is no demented 
horror ripping itself out of her. Her eyes snap about 
wildly, slowing focusing on the reality of her safety. 
Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads he~ breastbone 
with 
the heel of her hand and sobs. 
A VIDEO MONITOR beside the bed snaps on. The MED-TECH's 
face. 
MED-TECH 
Bad dreams again? Do you want 
something to help you sleep? 
RIPLEY 
( faint) 
No. I've slept enough. 
The tech shrugs and switches off. Touching a button on 
the night stand Ripley opens the viewport, REVEALING 
Gateway and the turquoise Earth. She hugs Jones to 
her and rocks with him like a child, still shattered 
by the nightmare. 
EXT. PARK 
Sunlight streams in shafts through a stand 
beyond which a verdant meadow is VISIBLE. 
toward a bird hopping among fal1en· leaves. 
And smacks into A WALL. 
RIPLEY 
(voice over) 
That's brilliant, Jones. CUT TO: 
of poplars, 
Jones stalks 
He leaps. 
vlISER: As 
Jones steps back confused from the HIGH-RESOLUTION 
ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of Cinerama video-loop. 
Ripley sits on a bench in what we now SEE is an ATRIUM off 
the medical center. Burke ENTERS in his usual mode, 
casual haste. 
BURKE 
Sorry •.. I've been running behind 
al 1 morning. 
RIPLEY 
Have they located my daughter 
yet? 
BURKE 
Weil, I 
was going to wait until 
after the inquest ...

He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printer hard 
copy, including a telestat photo. 
"RIPLEY 
I she .•. ? 
BURKE 
(scanning) 
Amanda Ripley-Mcclaren. Married 
name, I guess. Age: sixty-six ••. 
at 
time of death. Two years ago. 
(looks at her) 
I'm sorry. 
Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned. The face of a 
woman in her mid-sixties. It could be anybody. She 
tries to reconcile the face with the little girl she 
once knew. 
RIPLEY 
Any. 
BURKE 
(reading) 
Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't 
licked that one. Cremated. Interred 
Westlake Repository, Little Chute, 
Wisconsin. No children. 
Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the past. 
RIPLEY 
No children. 
(a beat, then) 
I promised her I'd be home for her 
birthday. Her eleventh birthday. 
BURKE 
Some promises you just can't keep. 
Let's get one thing straight .•. Ripley can be one tough 
lady. But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in 
this moment, overwhelming. She cries silently. Burke 
puts a reassuring hand on her arm. 
BURKE 
The hearing convenes at 0930. You 
don't want to be late. 
INT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY 
Elevator doors part and Ripley emerges, in mid-conversation 
with Burke.

RIPLEY 
You read my deposition ... it's 
complete and accurate. 
BURKE 
Look,! believe 
you, but there are 
going to be some heavyweights in 
there. You got feds, you got 
interstellar commerce commission, 
you got colonial administration, 
insurance company guys •.• 
RIPLEY 
I get the picture. 
BURKE 
Just tell them what happened. The 
important thing is to stay cool and 
unemotional. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY 
Not cool. Not unemotional. 
RIPLEY 
Do you people have earwax, or what. 
We have been here three hours. How 
many different ways do you want me 
to tell the same story? 
She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at 
a long conference table. Gray suits and grim faces. They 
aren't buying. Behind Ripley on a large VIDEOSCREEN, 
PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot. His 
file prints out next to it. BRETT'S face and dissier 
replace it, and then the others as the scene continues ... 
KANE, LMABERT, ASH 
the android traitor, DALLAS. VAN LEUWEN, 
the ICC representative, steeples his fingers and frowns. 
VAN LEUWEN 
Look at it from our perspective, 
please. You freely admit to 
detonating the engines of, and 
thereby destroying an M-Class 
star freighter. A rather expensive 
piece of hardware ..•

Forty-two million in adjusted dollars. 
That's munus payload, of course.

The lifeboat's flight recorder 
corroborates s.ome elements of your 
account. Tha-r-Tcr reasons unknown 
the Nostromo set down on LV-426, an 
unserveyed planet at that time. That 
it resumed its course and was 
subsequently set for self-destruct. 
By you. For reasons unknown. 
RIPLEY 
Look, I told you, we set down htere 
on company orders to get this thing, 
which destroyed all of us and your 
precious ship ... 
VAN LEUWEN 
The recorder did not contain any 
entries concerning this hostile 
organism you allegedly picked up. 
RIPLEY 
Oh, that's cute. Allegedly. 
I like that. 
Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation. 
VAN LEUWEN 
The analysis team wich went over the 
lifeboat centimeter by centimeter 
found no physical evidence of the 
creature you describe .. .' 
RIPLEY 
That's 
because I blew it out the 
Goddamn airlock! 
(pause) 
Like I said. 
INSURANCE MAN 
(to the ECA rep) 
Are there any species like this 
'hostile organism' on LV-426? 
ECA REP 
No. It's a rock. No indigenous 
life. 
Ripley grits her teeth in frustration. 
RIPLEY 
What? Did 
IQ's drop sharply while 
I was gone? I already said it was 
non indigenous. Thera was 
a derelict 
spacecraft. An alien ship. It wasn't 
from there. Get it? We homed on its 
beacon ...

(she reads from 
Ripley's statement) 
... 'gestates inside a living human 
host,' these are your words, and has 
'concentrated acid for blood.' 
RIPLEY 
Look, I can see where this is going. 
But I'm telling you those things 
exist. Kane, the guy that went in, 
said he saw thousands of eggs in that 
ship. Thousands ... 
VAN LEUWEN 
Thank you, Officer Ripley. That 
will be ..• 
RIPLEY 
You're not listening. Just one of 
those things managed to kill my 
entire crew --
Van Leuwen stands, out of oatience. 
VAN LEUWEN 
Thank you! That will be all. 
RIPLEY 
(shouting) 
That's not all, Goddammit! 
It those things get back here, 
that will be all. Then you 
can""'just kiss all this good-bye, 
just kiss it good-bye. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Ripley kicks the wall next to Burke who is getting coffee 
and donuts at a vending machine. 
BURKE 
You had them eating out of your 
hand, kiddo. 
RIPLEY 
They had their minds made up before 
I even went in there. They think 
I'm some kind of headcase. 
BURKE

You are a headcase. Have a donut. 9

Van 
Leuwen clears his throat. 
VAN LEUWEN 
It is the finding of this board of 
inquiry that Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley, 
NOC-14472, has acted with questior.able 
judgment 
and is unfit to hold an ICC 
license as a commercial flight officer. 
Burke watches Ripley taking it on the chin, white lipped 
but subdued. 
VAN LEUWEN 
Siad license is hereby suspended 
indefinitely. No criminal charges 
will be filed at this time and you 
are released on own recognizance 
for a six month period of psychometric 
probation, to include monthly review 
by an ICC psychiatric tech .•. 
Ripley's video-dossier fills teh screen behind her. At 
the bottom a new entry prints out: FILE CLOSED. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
DOLLY BACK as the conference room door bangs open and 
Ripley strides through. She shrugs off iurke's restraining 
arm 
and catches up to Van Leuwen walking down the corridor. 
RIPLEY· 
Why won't you just check out LV-426? 
VAN LEUWEN 
Because I don't have to. There have 
been people there for over twenty 
years and they never reported any 
hostile organism. 
RIPLEY 
What are you talking about? What 
people? 
Van Leuwen steps into an elevator with some others, but 
Ripley holds the door from closing. 
VAN LEUWEN 
Terraformers ..• planet engineers. 
They go in, set up these big atmosphere 
processors to make the air breathable. 
Takes decades. It's what we call a 
shake 'n bake colony. 
The door tries to close again. Ripley slams it back. 
People are getting annoyed.

How many are there? How many 
colonists?

EXT. ALIEN LANDSCAPE - DAY 
PANNING SLOWLY ACROSS a storm-blasted vista of tortured 
rock and bleak twilight onto a metal sign which reads: 
HADLEY'S HOPE~ POP.

Some local has added "have a nice day" with a spray can. 
Gale-force wind SCREECHES around the corroded sign. In 
the b.g. is the COLONY, a squat complex surrounded by an 
angled storm-barrier wall.

SEVERAL ANGLES ESTABLISHING the town, a cluster of bunkerlike

kilometers of barren heath, b.g., is the massave ATMOSPHERE 
PROCESSOR, looking like an oil refinery bred with an active 
volcano. 
12 INT. COLONY - MAIN CONCOURSE 12 
A wide corridor bustiling with routine activity. We SEE a 
cross-section of the hardy frontier stock who have come 
to live in this Godforsaken wilderness. Some CHILDREN 
race in the corridor on wheeled plastic toys. 
13 INT. OPERATIONS ROOM/ CONTORL BLOCK 13 
The nerve-center of the colony, jammed with computer 
terminals, displays, technicians. 
DOLLYING AHEAD OF SIMPSON, the harried OPERATIONS MANAGER, 
as he is approached by his assistant, LYDECKER. 
SIMPSON 
What? 
LYDECKER 
You remember you sent some wildcatters 
out to the middle of nowhere last week? 
Out past the Ilium range.

he' S• onto s.omething 
and wants to know will his claim be 
honored. 
SIMPSON 
Why wouldn't his claim be honored? 
LYDECKER 
Well because you sent them to that 
particular middle of nowhere on 
company orders, maybe. I don't 
know. 
SIMPSON 
Christ. Some honch in a cushy office 
on Earth says go look at a grid 
reference, we look. They don't say 
why, and I don't ask. I don't ask 
because it takes two weeks to get 
an answer out here and the answer's 
always 'don't ask.' 
LYDECKER 
So what do I tell this guy? 
SIMPSON 
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, 
he finds something it's his. 
EXT. ACHERON -THE 
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE -DAY 
AN EIGHT-WHEELED 
TRACTOR roars across corrugated rock, 
blasting through soggy drifts of volcanic ash. 
INT. TRACTOR 
At the controls, intent on a PINGING scope, is RUSS JORDEN, 
independent porspector. Beside him is his wife/partner 
Annie and in the back their two kids are playing among the 
heavy sampling equipment.

Holy shiiit! 
ANGLE THROUGH FRONT CANOPY: on a bizarre shape looming 
ahead. An enormous bonelike mass projecting upward from 
the bed of ash. Canted on its side and buckled against a 
rock outcorpping by the lava flow, it is still recognizable 
as an EXTRATERRESTRIAL SHIP. Bio-mechanoid. Non-human

Jorden and Anne step down, wearing ENVIRONMENT SUITS. 
Carrying LIGHTS, PACKS, CAMERAS, TEST GEAR. Their breath

They pause at the enormous gash in the hull. Blackness

As Anne shouts the Mayday Newt looks past her, to the 
ground. Russ Jorden lies there inert, dragged somehow 
by Anne from inside the ship. There is SOMETHING ON

Ripley, looking haggard, sits at a table in the 
dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from her 
cigarette. The place is minimal, the bed is unmade, there· 
are dishes in the sink. Jones prowls across the counter. 
The WALLSCREEN is on, a vapid commercial. 
The door BUZZES. Ripley jumps like a cat. Jones doesn't.

Forget it! It's not my problem.

Look, we don't know what's going on out 
there. It may just be a down 
transmitter. But if it's not, I want 
you there ... as an advisor. That's all. 
GORMAN 
You wouldn't be going in with the 
troops. I can guarantee your safety. 
BURKE 
These Colonial Marines are some 
tough hombres, and they're packing 
state~of-the-art firepower.

It's okay, you gotta stay busy. 
Nothing wrong with it. But what if 
I said I could get you reinstated as 
a flight officer? And that the company 
has agreed to pick up your contract? 
RIPLEY 
If I go. 
BURKE 
If you go. It's a second chance, kiddo. 
And it'll be the best thing in the 
world for you to face this fear and beat 
it. You gotta get back on the horse •.. 
RIPLEY 
Spare me, Burke. I've had my psych 
evaluation this month. 
Burke leans close, a let's-cut-the-crap intimacy. 
BURKE 
Yeah, and I've read it. You wake up 
every night, sheets soaking, the same 
nightmare over and over .•• 
RIPLEY 
No! The answer is no! Now please

ON RIPLEY: as they move along the corridor ... reacting to 
the fact that she is back in alien-country. She sees the 
ravaged administration complex. Fire-gutted offices. Hicks 
notices her looking around nervously. He motions to Frost 
with his eyes and the trooper casually falls in beside her 
on the other side, rifle at ·ready. A two-man protective 
cordon. She glances at Hicks. He winks, but so fast 
maybe it's something in his eye. Trooper DRAKE emerges from 
a side corridor ahead.

This wing is completely without power. The troopers switch 
on their pack lights and the beams illuminate a scene of

DRAKE 
Right ahead here ••. 
They approach a barricade blocking the corridor, a 
hastily-welded wall of pipes, steel-plate, outer-door 
panels. Acid holes have slashed through floor and walls in 
several places. The metal is scratched and twisted by 
hideously powerful forces, peeled back like a soup can on 
one side. They squeeze through the opening. 
INT. MED LAB 
The pack-lights play over the devastation of the colonists' 
last ditch battle. The equipment of the med labs has

The others turn and approach, seeing what she sees. She 
has entered a second room, part of the med lab area. In 
a storage alcove at near eye-level stand seven transparent 
cylinders. STASIS TUBES. 
They seem to contain SEVERED ARTHRITIC HANDS, the palsied 
fingers curled in a death-rictus.

forward. Trusting his judgment. She crouches beside him. 
RIPLEY'S P.O.V.: lit by Hicks' pack-light ..• a tiny cowering 
figure. A very dirty, very terrified NEWT JORDEN. She 
clutches a plastic food packet in one hand, its top gnawed 
partway through. In the other hand she grips the HEAD OF A 
LARGE DOLL, holding it by the hair. Just the head. 
RIPLEY

Come on out. It's all right ... 
Ripley moves toward her, reaching slowly under the cabinet. 
The kid bolts like a shot, scuttling along beneath the 
cabinetry. Ripley scrambles to follow .•. to keep her in 
sight. Hicks makes a grab, catching one tiny ankle. He 
snaps his hand out a moment later. 
HICKS 
Ow! Shit. Watchit, she bites. 
The girl reaches an air duct set in the baseboard, and 
scrambles inside. 
DRAKE 
Let her go, man. Who cares? 
Ripley dives, squirms into the duct without thinking. Just 
ahead she sees Newt enter a dark space and slam a steel 
hatch. Ripley pushes the hatch open before the child 
can latch it, and crawls in after her. 
Newt is backed into a cul-de-sac in the tiny steel chamber. 
Ripley 
shines her light around in amazement. It is a NEST. 
A nest built by a child. Wadded up blankets and pillows 
line the space, mixed up with a haphazard array of TOYS, 
STUFFED ANIMALS, DOLLS, CHEAP JEWELRY, COMIC BOOKS, EMPTY 
FOOD PACKETS, even a battery-operated TAPE PLAYER. 
Newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch. 
Ripley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug. The kid 
struggles wildly, like a cat at the vet's. 
RIPLEY 
It's okay, it's okay. It's over .••

COCOONS protrude from the niches and interstices of the 
structure. The cocoon material is the same translucent 
epoxy. The bodies are frozen in twisted positions. Rib 
cages burst outward, exploded from within. Paralyzed, then 
brought here as hosts for the embryos which grew within them. 
Arrayed across the floor are a number of LEATHERY OVOIDS, 
alien eggs, their tops open like flower petals. Apone shines 
his light into one. Empty and dry. His beam crosses the 
floor, finding one of the multi-legged parasites, curled 
up and shrivelled like a dead spider. Others lie at the 
feet of the cocooned colonists, graphically illustrating the 
bizarre life-cycle. 
Dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures, perhaps

troopers carrying flamethrowers open fire. An orgy of 
purging fire. The cocoons vanish in the shimmering heat.

Hicks pushes Hudson inside, leaps in after him and drags 
Vasquez inside, massive gear and all. She sees a DARK

Clean body hit. The flash lights up the inhuman grin,

Suddenly CLAWS appear at the edge. The door is being SLOWLY 
WRENCHED OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE. Hicks yells at a paralyzed 
Gorman. 
HICKS 
Get on the Goddamn door! 53

Gorman backs away, eyes wide. Hicks jams his shoulder 
against the latching lever and frees one hand 
to raise his 
12-gauge. An alien head wedges through the opening, its 
hideous mouth opening. And Hicks jams his SHOTGUN MUZZLE 
between its jaws and pulls the trigger! BLAM! The creature 
is flung backward, its shattered head fountaining acid blood. 
The spray eats into the door, the deck, hits Hudson on the 
arm. He shrieks. They slide the door home and dog it tight.

pivoting the massive machine. Everybody's shouting, trying 
to put out the fire. Pandemonium. 
The AFC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for clear 
air, its flank trailing fire like a comet. Ripley fights 
the controls as the big machine slews, broadsiding a control 
room out-building. Office furniture and splintered wall 
sections are strewn in the APC's wake.

The creature flips off, landing in the headlights. Ripley 
hits full throttle. The APC roars forward, smashing over 
the abomination. Its skeletal body is crushed under the 
massive 
wheels. The machine thunders out onto the open 
landscape and away from the station. A sound like bolts 
dropped in a meat grinder is coming from the APC's rear end. 
Hicks eases Ripley's hand OaCK on the throttle lever. Her 
grip is white knuckled. 
HICKS 
It's okay ... we're clear. We're

The grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she slows

Everyone, including Bishop, is crowded at the window, 
intently watching the AP station which is a dim silhouette 
in the mist. Suddenly a column of flame, like an acetylene 
torch, jets upward from the complex at the base of the cone. 
BISHOP 
That's it. Emergency venting. 
HICKS 
How long until it blows? 
BISHOP 
Four hours. The blast radius will 
be about thirty kilometers. About 
equal to twenty megatons. 
HICKS 
We got problems.

That up-link tower down at the

BISHOP 
No, I checked. The hardwiring between

align the dish. 
Ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out 
options, grim solutions. 
RIPLEY

One of the acid holes from the colonists' seige has 
yielded access to sub-floor conduits. Bishop, lying in 
the 
opening, reaches up to grasp the portable terminal 
as Ripley hands it down to him. He pushes it into the 
constricted shaft ahead of him. She then hands him a 
small satchel containing tools and assorted patch cables, 
a service pistol and a small cutting torch. 
RIPLEY 
How long? 
BISHOP 
Let's see, this duct runs almost to the 
up-link assembly. One hundred eighty 
meters. Say, forty minutes to crawl 
down there. One hour to patch in and 
align the antenna. Thirty minutes to 
prep the ship, then about fifty minutes 
flight time.

ahead of him with a scraping rhythm. Vasquez slides a 
metal plate over the hole and begins spot-welding it in

Ripley jumps up, unslinging a FLAMETHROWER from her shoulder 
in one motion, and sprints for Operations with Vasquez. The 
sound of SENTRY GUNS opening up in staccato bursts echoes 
from close by.

Ripley runs to the tactical console where Hicks is 
mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras. 
The flashes of the sentry-guns flare-out the sensitive

hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into the

a tiny shaft of light. He puts his eyes up to the 
acid-etched opening.

Entering the darkened chamber, Ripley looks around. Newt 
is nowhere to be seen. On a hunch she kneels down and 
peers under the bed.• Newt is curled up there, jammed as 
far back as she can get, fast asleep. Still clutching 
"Casey. " 
Ripley stares at Newt's tiny face, so angelic despite the 
cemons that 
have chased her through her dreams and the reality 
between dreams. Ripley lays the rifle on top of the cot 
and crawls carefully underneath. Without waking the 
little girl, she slips her arms around her. Newt cries 
out, a vague inarticulate plea. Ripley rocks her gently.

There, there. Ssshh. It's all

Across the room, just inside the door to the med lab, are 
TWO STASIS CYLINDERS. Their tops are hinged open, and the 
suspension fields are switched off. They are both EMPTY. 
Ripley realizes the inescapable ~ertainty of 
a lethal

NEWT 
Wha .•. ? Where are •... ? 
RIPLEY 
Sssh. Don't move. We're in trouble. 
Newt nods, now wide awake. They listen in the darkness for 
the slightest betrayal of movement. Ripley reaches up and, 
clutching the springs of the underside of the cot, begins 
to inch it away from the wall. 
When the space is wide enough she cautiously slides herself 
up between the wall and the edge of the cot, reaching for 
the rifle she left lying on top of the mattress. Her eyes 
clear the 
edge of the bed. The rifle is GONE. 78 
141 
She snaps her head around. A SCUTTLING SHAPE LEAPS TOWARD 
HER. She ducks. The obscene thing hits the wall above her. 
Reflexively she slams the bed against the wall, pinning the 
creature inches above her face. Its legs and tail writhe 
with incredible ferocity. 
Ripley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a 
frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot. She flips it 
over, trapping the creature underneath. 
They back away, gasping. The creature scuttles from beneath 
the bed and disappears under a bank of cabinets in a blur. 
Ripley hugs Newt close and heads toward the door, moving as 
if every object in the room had a million volts running 
through it. She reaches the door. Hits the wall switch. 
Nothing happens. Disabled from outside. She tries the 
lights. Nothing. She pounds on the door. The 
accoustically dampened door panel thunks dully. She moves 
to the observation window. 
RIPLEY 
(shouting) 
Hey ••. hey! 
She pounds the window. Through the double thickness window 
we can SEE that the lab is dark end empty. Ripley whirls, 
hearing a loathsome scrabbling behind her. Newt starts to 
whimper, feeding off her fear. She steps in front of the 
video surveillance camera and waves her arms in a circle. 
RIPLEY

Ripley picks up a steel chair and slams it against the 
observation window. It bounces back from the high-impact 
material. 
Ripley turns, studying the room. Newt starts a thin, 
high 
wailing. 
Ripley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror and the 
child's dependence on her. She gets an idea. Removes her 
lighter from a jacket pocket and picks up some papers from 
the counter. Moving cautiously she boosts Newt up onto 
the SURGICAL TABLE in the center of the room and clambers 
up after her. 
NEWT

Ripley and Newt are drenched as the sprinklers continue to 
drizzle in the darkness. She is eye-level with a complex 
surgical MULTILIGHT. She looks into its tangle 
of arms 
and cables, inches away. Looks away. Her eyes snap back. 
SOMETHING LEAPS AT HER FACE. She SCREAMS and topples off 
the table, splashing to the floor. Newt shrieks and 
scrambles away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off 
of her. It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings for a 
moment, then leaps back as if driven by a steel spring. 
Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling equipment over on top 
of herself, clawing across the floor in a frenzy of motion. 
The creature scuttles up her body. She tears at it, but it 
is incredibly powerful for its size. It moves like lightning 
toward her head, avoiding her Dumbling hands. 
Newt screams 
abjectly, backing away, until she is pressed up against a 
desk in one corner. Ripley has both hands up, forcing the 
pulsing body back from her face. The thing's tail whips 
around her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the 
underside of its body close to her. Ripley thrashes about, 
knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING. 
ANGLE ON NEWT: as crablike legs appear from behind the desk, 
right behind her.· She sees it and, thinking fast, jams the 
desk against the wall, pinning the writhing thing. The desk 
jumps and shudders against all the pressure her tiny body can 
bring to bear on it. She wails between gritted teeth as the 
second creature gets one leg free, then another and another. 
The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's head, 
getting a surer grip even as she whips her heud from 
side to 
side. The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly from the sheath on 
the creature's underside, forcing itself between the arms 
she has crossed tightly over her face. 
A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette 
behind the misted-over glass. A hand wipes a clear spot. 
Hicks' eyes appear. He steps back. WHAM! A burst of 
pulse-fire shatters the tempered glass. Hicks dives into 
the crazed spiderweb pattern and explodes into the room. He 
hits rolling, and slides across to Ripley. He gets his 
fingers around the thrashing legs of the vicious beast and 
pulls. Between the two of them they force it away from her 
face, though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens 
sickeningly around her throat. Hudson leaps into the room, 
flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding across the wet 
floor, and blasts the second creature against the wall. 
Point-blank. Acid and smoke. 
Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail, 
unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor coil 
from her throat. All of them grip the struggling, SHRIEKING 
creature.

It's locked. 
HICKS 
Stand back. 
Hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the lock. 
Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor. Vasquez 
hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unslings her rifle. 
She starts loading 30mm grenades into 
the launcher, like 
oversize 12-gauge shells. Hicks kicks the door in, molten 
droplets flying. 
INT. MED LAB ANNEX 156 
They enter a small cubicle, Vasquez trailing. She slides 
the door almost closed, then fires three grenades rapid-fire 
through the gap. She slams the door home as the grenades 
detonate, the explosion sounding gonglike through the metal. 
Ripley sprints across the room, trying the far door. Burke 
has locked it as well. Hicks switches his hand-torch from 
CUT to WELD and starts sealing the door they just passed 
through. 
INT. MED LAB 157 
Burke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the dark 
chamber. Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he crosses to 
the door leading to the main concourse. His fingers reach 
for the latch. It moves by itself. The door opens slowly. 
ON BURKE: his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate.. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MED LAB ANNEX 158 
The door dimples with a clanging impact, separating slightly 
from its frame. Another crash, the squeal of tortured steel. 
Newt grabs Ripley by the hand and tugs her across the room. 
NEWT 
Corne on! This way. 
She leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and 
expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open. Newt starts 
inside but Ripley pulls her back.

Ripley trades her rifle for Gorman' s flamethrowe.r before 
he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a tight 
fit. Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks, Gorman 
and Vasquez on rearguard. Glancing back fearfully Newt 
pushes on Ripley's butt as they crawl rapidly through the 
shaft. 
NEWT 
Come on. Crawl faster . 
. RIPLEY 
Do 
you know how to get to the 
landing field from here? 
NEWT 
Sure. Go left. 
Ripley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there is enough 
room to crab-walk in a low crouch. She runs, scraping her 
back on the ceiling. The troopers' armor clatters in the 
confined space. They approach an intersection. She fires 
the flamethrower around the corner, then looks. Clear. 
NEWT 
Go right. 88 
158 
They sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze 
becoming a blur. Ripley fires the flamethrower periodically, 
as they pass side ducts covered by louvered grilles or 
vertical shafts going to higher or lower levels. 
HICKS

There is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almost 
unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio.

out of the wind which is now gusting viciously.

HICKS 
All right, stand by there. We're 
on our way. Over. 
The beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the 
tunnel ahead. She blinks, seeing something ... not sure. A 
GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling the 
tunnel at the absolute limit of.the light's 
power. 
RIPLEY 
Back. Go back! 
They try to crawl back, jamming together. Behind. them, the 
way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with a 
FEROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrior flows 
into the duct. They are trapped. Vasquez opens fire with 
her pulse rifle. Hicks snaps out his hand-welder and cuts 
into the wall of the duct. Vasquez goes empty and reloads 
with icy precision. Bracing his back, Hicks kicks hard at 
the cherry-hot metal. It bends aside. 
Beyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes and conduit. 
Hicks slides through the searing hole, lifting Newt safely 
through as Ripley hands her out. Ripley follows and turns 
to help Gorman. Vasquez' pulse gun runs empty. She draws 
her SERVICE PISTOL. Suddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR 
SCREECHES DOWN FROM A VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her. 
She fires with incredible rapidity .•• BAM! BAM! BAM! Rolls 
aside. It lands on her legs and she snaps her head to one 
side just its TAIL-STINGER buries into the metal wall 
beside her cheek. She fires again, emptying the pistol, 
kicking the thrashing shape away. 
Acid cuts through her armor, searing into her thigh. She 
grits her teeth against the white-hot pain. Gorman sees 
Vasquez hit, unable to move. Sees the creatures coming the 
other way ... and turns away from the escape hole. He crawls 
back to her, grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her 
toward safety. Too late. They are cut off. Vasquez sees him, 
barely conscious. 
VASQUEZ 
You always were an asshole, Gorman. 
She seizes his hand in a deathly grip, but we recognize it 
as the "power greeting" she shared with Drake ..• something 
for the chosen few. Gorman returns the grip. He hands her 
two grenades and arms two himself. INT. SERVICE WAY

The kid moves like lightning, diving and dodging around 
obstacles. They reach a large metal housing and Newt crawls 
inside. 
NEWT 
Here! Go up. _There's a shortcut 
across the roof. 
It is a junction of several shafts, including a vertical duct 
with ladder rungs leading up to an exterior vent hood. The 
"floor" is actually the top of a large blower drum, a vaned 
cylinder. 
Ripley crosses to the ladder, seizes a rung to steady herself, 
and reaches back for Newt. The blower rotates suddenly as 
their weight shifts and Newt falls, slipping nightmarishly 
through a narrow gap into another duct, a chute angling into 
the depths at 45°. She catches the lip of the chute and holds 
on. 
NEWT 
Riiiipppleee 
Ripley dives, getting one arm through the opening as Hicks 
steadies the drum, but she can't squeeze through the gap. 
She strains, her hand groping for Newt's. Their fingers miss, 
inches apart. 
In a desperate lunge Hicks seizes the sleeve of Newt's 
oversize jacket just as she loses her grip AND SHE SLIPS OUT 
OF IT. With an echoing scream Newt plummets, sliding,down 
the 
chute into darkness, disappearing around a bend. Ripley 
screams after the child. 
RIPLEY 
NEWT! 
The shaft recedes into darkness. No answer. Ripley yells 
again. Nothing. Then ... 
a plaintive call from the darkness. 
Echoey, distorted, terrified.

Halfway along the corridor, Ripley stops. Looking down 
through the floor grating she sees Newt's tear-streaked face.

bars of the grate. Ripley squeezes the child's precious 
fingertips.

Newt, standing waist deep in water, watches sparks shower 
blindingly as Hicks cuts. Silently a glistening shape rises 
in one graceful motion from the water behind her. It stands, 
dripping, dwarfing her tiny form. She SCREAMS as the shadow 
engulfs her. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Ripley panics, hearing the screaming below, then splashing. 
She and Hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashing it 
down. Ripley lunges into the hole with her light. The 
surface of the water reflects the beam placidly. Newt is 
gone. Bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is "Casey" the 
doll head. It sinks slowly, distorting, vanishing in 
darkness. 
Hicks pulls Ripley away from the hole. She struggles 
furiously, trying to tear out of his grip. 
RIPLEY 
No! Nooooo! 
He drags her back. It takes all his strength. 
HICKS

She's gone. Let's go! 
He sees something moving toward them through a la~tice of

it. But we gotta get moving! Now! 166 
He drags her toward an ELEVATOR not far away at the end of 
the tunnel. Gets her inside, slamming her against the back 
wall. Hits the button to go to surface level. An alien 
warrior leaps into the tunnel, starts toward them. The 
doors are closing. Not fast enough. The creature, gets one 
arm through, the doors closing on it. THEY OPEN AGAIN, an 
automatic safety feature. THE WARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING.

Slides sideways. Stops. Bishop turns as Ripley and Hicks 
stumble toward him. He goes to them, helping to support 
Hicks and they run toward the ship, buffeted by the gale. 
Ripley shouts, her words barely audible over the

Ripley finishes winding tape around a bulky object and drops

rapidly, snatching magazines, grenades, belts and other 
gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the drop-ship.

Attaches a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness. Primes the 
flamethrower. She checks the MARKING FLARES jammed in the 
thigh pockets of her jump pants. 
This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done. She 
begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat. The elevator 
descends. The lift motors whine, slowing. It hits bottom 
with a bump. The safety cage retracts. Slowly, expectantly, 
the doors open ... 
HER P.O.V.: THROUGH the parting doors ... an empty corridor. 
Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow VISIBLE here and there. 
It seems to have been a descent into Dantean Hell. Like the 
beating of a vast heart the pounding of massive pumps echoes 
through the station.

Ripley moves out of the lift, knuckles white on the rifle. 
Behind her we SEE a SECOND ELEVATOR next to hers, its lift 
cage somewhere on a higher floor. Not far ahead the 
bio-mechanoid catacomb begins. She enters the maze, darting 
glances at Hicks' LOCATOR, taped to the top of her weapon. 
A VOICE echoes down the tunnels, calm and mechanical.

Ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes, moving through the 
swirling steam of the alien maze. She approaches an 
intersecting tunnel. Flashing emergency lights illuminate 
the insane fresco of the walls. She spins, firing the 
flame thrower. Nothing there. She moves forward. The 
locator signal strengthens as she turns, crouches through 172 
a low passage, turns again. At each intersection she quickly 
lights a FIFTEEN MINUTE MARKING FLARE and drops it. For

human bas-relief sealed in resin.

Ripley moves ahead. 
The locator signal shows she. is almost 
there. A CONCUSSION rocks the place, like an earthquake, 
jarring her almost off her feet. The whole station seems to 
shudder. Following the tracker she turns a corner and stops. 
The RANGE INDICATOR READS ZERO. She looks down, horrified 
to see Newt's tracer bracelet lying on the floor of the 
tunnel. All hope recedes, disintegrating into mindless 
chaos. 
INT. EGG CHAMBER 173 
Newt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at the edge of 
a cluster of alien eggs. Her eyelids flutter open and she 
becomes aware of her surroundings. The egg nearest her 
begins to move ..• opening like an obscene flower. Newt stares, 
transfixed by terror, as jointed legs appear over the lip 
of the ovoid one by one. She SCREAMS.

flash illuminates the figure of an adult warrior, nearby. 
It spins, moving straight for Ripley. Firing from the hip 
she drills it with two controlled bursts which catapult it 
back. She steps toward it, FIRING AGAIN. Her expression is 
murderous. AND AGAIN. 
It spins onto its back. She unleashes the flamethrower and 
it vanishes in a fireball. Ripley runs to Newt and begins

Hang on real tight. Okay? 
Newt nods groggily and hooks her arms and legs through 
Ripley's battle harness. Ripley turns to retrace her 
steps only to have an explosion on a lower level engulf the 
passageway in an enormous fireball. She retreats, moving 
into a LARGE CHAMBER, its floor an expanse of eggs. A 
PIERCING SHRIEK fills the chamber. She turns. And there 
it is •.. 
A massive silhouette ·in the 
mist, the ALIEN QUEEN glowers 
over her eggs like a great, glistening black insect-Buddha. 
What's bigger and meaner than the Alien? His momma. Her 
fanged head is an unimaginable horror. Her six limbs, the 
four arms and two powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over 
her distended abdomen. The egg-filled abdomen swells and 
swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended from a 
lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike membrane as if 
some vast coil of intestine was draped carelessly among the 
machinery. 
As Ripley backs away from the Queen, deeper into the egg 
chamber she becomes aware of a number of warriors moving 
toward her from the dim recesses. She fires the flame thrower 
above the rows of eggs and then lowers her aim toward the 
eggs, while staring fixedly at the Queen. The warriors 
freeze. A nightmare tableau. Ripley fires another warning 
jet of flame. The warriors move back into the shadows, 
clearly at the Queen's direction. A Mexican stpndoff between 
two 
females fighting for their young. Ripley backs slowly 
across the chamber until she reaches an exit tunnel. Then 
she unleashes the flame thrower, igniting the field of eggs 
with an insane fury. The Queen goes berserk, SCREECHING 
like some psychotic steam whistle. 
Ripley pumps the slide on her irenade launcher. 
She fires. 
Pumps and fires again. Four times. The 
grenades punch deep 
into the egg sac and EXPLODE, ripping it open from within. 
Eggs and tons of gelatinous matter pour across the chamber 
floor. 
Everything disappears behind a wall of fire. Ripley drops 
a magazine and grabs another from her belt, ramming it home 
just as a warrior leaps from the inferno like a living fireball 
She blasts it. back 
to hell with a long burst. She unslings 
the bandolier of grenades, primes one, and throws the whole

multiple explosions. j

freight elevators. A mass of debris, falling down the shaft 
from a high level, has demolished the lift cage she descended 
in. She slams the control for the other cage and hears the 
sound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins its slow descent 
from several levels up. AN ENRAGED SCREECH ECHOES in the

Looking down through the grille she sees the great horrifying 
jaws directly below her, wet and leering. She scrambles up,

away from the doors toward the railing. There is no place 
to run to on the platform. EXPLOSIONS detonate in the 
complex far below and huge fireballs well upward through the 
machinery. The platform bucks wildly. Nearby a cooling tower 
collapses with a THUNDEROUS ROAR and the SHRIEK OF RENDING

inside one landing-leg bay. It blends perfectly with the 
machinery until it begins to emerge. Seizing Bishop in two 
great hands it rips him apart and flings him aside, shredded, 
like a doll. 
It descends slowly to the deck, the rotating 
lights glistening across its shiny black limbs, dripping 
acid and rage. Still smoking where Ripley half fried it. 
The Queen is huge, powerful ••. and very pissed off. It 
descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in inhuman 
geometries. 
Ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring 
hypnotized ... terrified to break and run. She lowers Newt 
to the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature. 
RIPLEY 
Go! 
Newt runs for cover. The alien drops to the deck, pivoting 
toward the motion. Ripley waves her arms, decoying. 
RIPLEY 
Here!

Without warning it moves like lightning, straight at her. 
Ripley spins, sprinting, as the creature leaps for her. Its 
feet slam, echoing, on the deck behind her. She clears a 
door. Hits the switch. It WHIRRS closed. BOOM. The alien 
hits a moment later. 
INT. DARK CHAMBER 
Ripley moves ferret-quick among dark, unrecognizable 
machines. 193 
VARIOUS ANGLES: VERY TIGHT ON what she is doing ... her feet 
going into stirruplike mechanisms. Velcro straps fastened 
over them. Fingers stabbing buttons in a sequence. Her 
hand closing on a complex grip-control. The HUM of powerful 
motors. The WHINE of hydraulics. 
INT. CARGO LOCK 
The Queen turns its attention from the doors to Newt as the 
little girl crawls into a system of trenchlike service 
channels which cross the deck. 
INT. CHANNEL 
Newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the 
alien appears above, SEEN THROUGH the bars. A section of 
grille is ripped away behind her. 
INT. CARGO LOCK 194 
195 
196 
The Queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her. The 
parting doors REVEAL an inhuman silhouette standing there. 
Ripley steps out, WEARING TWO TONS OF HARDENED STEEL. THE 
POWER LOADER. Like medieval armor with the power of a 
bulldozer. She takes a step .•. the massive foot CRASH-CLANGS 
to the deck. She takes another, advancing. 
RIPLEY 
Get away from her, you bitch! 
The Queen SCREECHES pure lethality 
and leaps. WALLOP! 
A roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches it on 
its hideous skull and slams it into a wall. It rebounds 
into a massive backhand. CRASH! It goes backward into 
heavy loading equipment. 
RIPLEY 
(screaming) 
Come on! 
The Queen emerges as a blur of rage, lashing with unbelievable 
fury. The battle is joined.

Claws swipe, tail lashes. Ripley parries with radical 
swipes of the steel forks. They circle in a whirling blur, 
demolishing everything in their path. The cavernous chamber 
echoes 
with nightmarish sounds •.. WHINE, CRASH, CLANG, . 
SCREECH. 
They lock in a death embrace. Ripley closes the forks, 
crushing two of the creature's limbs. It lashes and writhes 
with incredible fury, corning within inches of her exposed 
body. She lifts it off the ground. The hind legs rip at 
her, slamming agc:!,inst the safety cage, denting it in. The 
striking teeth extend almost a meter from inside its fanged 
maw, shooting between the crash-bars. She ducks and the 
teeth slam into the seat cushion behind her head in a spray 
of drool. Yellow acid foams down the hydraulic arms toward 
her. The creature rips at high-pressure hoses. Purple 
hydraulic fluid sprays ..• rnachine blood mixing with alien 
blood. They topple, off balance. The Queen pins her. 
Ripley hits a switch. The power-loader's CUTTING TORCH 
flares on, directly in the thing's face. They roll 
together, over the lip of a RECTANGULAR PIT, A VERTICAL 
LOADING AIRLOCK. 
INT. LOADING LOCK 
They crash together five meters below, twisted in the 
loader's wreckage. The alien shrieks, pinned. 
Ripley pulls her arm out of the controls of the loader and 
claws toward the panel of airlock actuating buttons. She 
slaps the red "INNER DOOR OVERRIDE" and latches the "HOLD" 
locking-key down. A KLAXON begins to sound. She hits 
"OUTER DOOR OPEN" and there is a hurricane shriek of air 
as the doors on which they are lying separate, REVEALING 
the infinite pit of stars, below. 197 
All this time the alien has ·oeen lashing at her in a frenzy 
and she has been parrying desperately in the confined space. 
The airlock becomes a wind tunnel, blasting and buffeting 
her as she struggles to unstrap from the loader. The air 
of the vast ship howls past her into space as she claws 
her way up a service ladder. 
INT. CARGO BAY 198 
Newt screams as the hurricane airstrearn sucks her across the 
floor toward the airlock. Bishop, torn virtually in two, 
grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for Newt as she 
slides past him. He catches her arm and hangs on as she 
dangles doll-like, in the airblast. )0 104 
INT. LOADING DOCK 199 
The alien seizes Ripley's ankle. She locks her arms around 
a ladder rung, feels them almost torn out of their shoulder 
sockets. 
The door opens farther, all of space yawning below. The 
loader tumbles clear, falling away. It drags the alien, 
still clutching one of Ripley's lucky hi-tops, into the 
depths of space. Its SHRIEK fades, is gone. 
With all her strength Ripley fights the blasting air, 
crawling over the lip of the inner doorway. She releases 
the OVERRIDE from a second panel. The inner doors close. 
The turbulent air eddies and settles. 
She lies on her back, drained of all strength. Gasping for 
breath. Weakly she turns her head, seeing Bishop still 
holding Newt by the arm. Encrusted with his own vanilla 
milkshake blood, Bishop gives her a 
small, grim smile. 
BISHOP 
Not bad for a human. 
He winks. Ripley crosses to Newt. 
NEWT 
(weakly) 
Mommy .•• Mommy? 
RIPLEY 
Right here, baby. Right here. 
Ripley hugs her desperately. 
INT. HYPERSLEEP 
Ripley sits at the edge of an open hypersleep capsule in 
which Newt is lying. Behind them, already going under, 
is Hicks and in a farther capsule, Bishop, wrapped in a 
plastic membrane. 
NEWT 
Are we going to sleep all the way 
back? 
RIPLEY 
That's right. 
NEWT 
Can we dream? 
RIPLEY 
Yes, honey. I think we both can.
