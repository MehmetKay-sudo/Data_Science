FADE IN:
EXT. DESERT - NIGHTA rabbit hops across rough terrain.
EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT
Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of
toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP454.
INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT
A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck.
SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
I will be self-assured andconfident around women.
PIG PEN
I will be self-assured andconfident around women.
EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT
The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first
truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crossesthe highway in front of the third.
INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT
SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
I will not fear the unexpected.
PIG PEN
I will not fear the unexpected.
The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.
PIG PEN
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the
bunny.
EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT
The truck slews crazily. Missing the bunny by a whisker.2.
INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHTPig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn’t regain
control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets therig together.
EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT
The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic
waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to thewater below.
EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT
A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips
beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from agash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neonink.
EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY
The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of
INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterflynet sweeps through the air to capture an oversizedhorsefly.
JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger
is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing withpeople.
JOSHUA
Hey, Mike. Check this one out.
MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look. Puberty hit hard
and fast for this bright, little nerd.
MIKE
He’s huge!
JOSHUA
They’ve been like this all week.Must be something extra tasty inthe water.
MIKE
Like what?
JOSHUA
Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Backin the ’Nam we’d eat python with adash of habanero sauce. Mightysatisfying.
(CONTINUED)3.
CONTINUED:
MIKE
You ate snake?
JOSHUA
When you ’re thirty klicks out from
the nearest firebase. Humpin ’
through the wake-up with yourfinger on the trigger. Charliedoesn’t give you time to stop for
cutlet.
As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a
familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly-colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.
EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA ’S HOUSE - DAY
Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of
nowhere.
INT. JOSHUA ’S HOUSE - DAY
The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and
homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Charlie, don ’t surf!
JOSHUA
Quiet, bird. We ’re working.
Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen
aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates aspecific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.
JOSHUA
(dims tank lights)
The sun is going down, mynocturnal hunters. It ’s time to
come out and feed.
Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.
MIKE
Yeah. They ’re definitely getting
bigger.
JOSHUA
I’ve calculated a growth factor of
twelve percent over the lastforty-eight hours. But that seemsto be accelerating.
(CONTINUED)4.
CONTINUED:
MIKE
All from eating these bugs? MaybeI should try some.
Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search
for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflagedden like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks thecricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.
Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting
spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at haplessinsects.
MIKE
Run, little guys.
JOSHUA
They can ’t outrun the food chain.
MIKE
I could get away.
JOSHUA
Imagine yourself the size of thatfly. A scytodes spitter would beas big as a Cadillac. You ’db e
spider chow, kid.
Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
crickets. He moves toward another tank that is coveredwith a towel.
MIKE
Are the new tarantulas in here?
JOSHUA
Took me forever to get a breedingset of Chilean reds. I must havebribed every customs agent fromVegas to Santiago.
Joshua unveils the tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow
entrances. Joshua pours in the bugs. A large, maletarantula comes out of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,then wraps its prey in webbing, turning the insect into amummy-like bundle.
MIKE
That is too cool.
JOSHUA
Male tarantulas compete for thefemale’s attention.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)5.
CONTINUED:
JOSHUA (CONT ’D)
Each one tries to bring her thebest present. Bugs, rats, eventhe occasional parrot.
CHARLIE SQUAWKS.
JOSHUA
The prey is cocooned alive so shecan eat them in her nest. Youknow how women love breakfast inbed.
Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of
subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulasscuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.
JOSHUA
Take a look, the female of thespecies is three times as big asthe male.
Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps
out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean redtarantula.
JOSHUA
Say hello to Consuela.
Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified
bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.
JOSHUA
She fills her prey with digestiveacid to liquify the internalorgans. Now watch... She ’ll drink
her victim from the inside out.While it ’s still alive!
MIKE
(looks queasy)
And you wonder why my mom doesn ’t
like me hanging out with you.
JOSHUA
Arachnids have been roaming theearth for millions of years. Andthey’ll be here long after the
human race is dead and buried.
Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass. Mike recoils.
MIKE
Bad! Bad Consuela!
Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated.6.
TARANTULA POV - MIKEThe multi-eyed spider ’s PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms
large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.
BACK TO MIKE
Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela.
MIKE
Do that again and I feed you tothe parrot.
CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily. The sound of a CAR HORN.
JOSHUA
There’s your mom.
MIKE
See you tomorrow, Joshua!
Mike heads for the door.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside.
A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on thedoor reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,PROSPERITY, NV.
INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY
Rotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a
string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end ofthe tunnel.
CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered
clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.
Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes
contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses toscrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.
Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away
a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflectionsof silver and gold splash across his face. His smilefades...
CHRIS
Damn.
(CONTINUED)7.
CONTINUED:Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A
large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris ’s
sack lunch.
Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The
rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikesrock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.
A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices
a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on astove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries awaywith lunch.
CHRIS
Hope you like bologna!

SAM
Why does he have all those things?
MIKE
He studies them. NASA uses spiderwebs in outer space. And formedicine. They ’ve been here

after we ’re all dead.
SAM
You’re givin ’me nightmares.
MIKE
Nightmares are cool.

Don’t you remember what it ’s like
to grow up here?
SAM
That’s what scares me.
(CONTINUED)12.

a stun gun. Mike passes it through the bars to Ashley.
SAM
I told you to keep this with you.
Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack.
ASHLEY
You are so over protective.
Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam ’s response.
SAM
A mother ’s job is to protect her
children.
ASHLEY
You need to start trusting me.
SAM
I’d like to. But you keep
skipping classes to go to thedunes with Bret.
ASHLEY
Why do you hate him so much?
SAM
I don’t hate him. I just want you
to have a future. I thought youwanted to get out of town. Go tomed school.
ASHLEY
Maybe I want to stay. I could getpregnant by nineteen. Thendivorce with a couple of kids Ican’t handle. Slap on a badge and
be a trailer trash sheriff.
SAM
(deeply hurt)
Thanks for the flashback.
They drive on in painful silence. Mike turns ON the

CHRIS
Right on.
EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY
Chris’s pickup approaches... The entire town is not much
bigger than a few football fields. The kind of placewhere everybody has known each other since childhood.Some buildings date back to the 1880 ’s gold rush.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Isn’t this just your latest get-
rich quick scheme?
At one end is the Prosperity Mall. A huge windowless
rectangle in the sand. Permanent signs tout the manyoutlet stores inside: Victoria ’s Secret, Home and Garden
Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc. Hand-painted signs reveal:"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE. EVERYTHING MUST GO. FINALCLOSE OUT." On the roof of the mall is a very tall radioantenna.

INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY
WADE (V.O.)
I don’t think it ’s fair for one

We have no economy! People arebarely scraping by! And now we ’ve
been offered the deal of alifetime. You don ’t have the
right to stand in our way!
CHRIS
Those mines are full of gas. Onespark in the wrong place couldblow this entire valley sky high.Do you really want to load thatgun with toxic waste?

WADE
I’m greedy?! You ’re the one
keeping us down so you can searchfor gold!
Chris tries to go after Wade. Sam holds him back.
SAM
Don’t take another step.
Chris stares at her.
CHRIS
You’re taking his side?
SAM
I’m trying to keep the peace.
WADE
You’re crazy! Just like your
father!
Wade drives off in his humvee. The crowd begins to
disperse.
CHRIS
(sotto)
He wasn’t crazy.
SAM
It’s okay.
Chris heads off to his truck. Sam watches him go. Her
eyes drifting down his body. Ashley steps up beside hermom.
ASHLEY

As Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a
drawer.
GLADYS
Did you pop him one?
CHRIS
He had it comin ’. But Sam
Palmer... That woman abuses herpower.
GLADYS
Why? Because she stopped you fromgivin’Wade another pop?
CHRIS
I’m not proud of it.
Chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that
honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked"explored." Many aren ’t. Chris checks another tunnel

Chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer.
Gladys enters with a stack of bills.
CHRIS
That burner ’s on the fritz again.

GLADYS
Honey, if he really does have abuyer...
CHRIS
You of all people know how much mydad wanted to find that motherlode.
GLADYS
Your daddy wanted to get rich. Idon’t think he cared how that
happened. If he was still alive,maybe he ’d sell those mines.
Chris takes umbrage...
CHRIS
And maybe you didn ’t know him so
well after all.
A tense beat.
GLADYS
You’re right... I ’m just worried
about how we ’re going to pay these
bills.
CHRIS
Don’t give up on me, Gladys. I
promised him I ’d find the gold.
And I will.

Me so horny. Me love you longtime.
Joshua doesn ’t look back at the parrot sitting on its
perch.
JOSHUA
Be quiet, bird!
Charlie looks over at the tarantula tank. Watching
curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly. As if oneof the spiders is escaping. Charlie flies over toinvestigate. He lands on the counter and peers aroundthe back of the tank.
CHARLIE
Charlie’s in the wire! Incoming!
Something yanks the parrot O.S.
JOSHUA
Stop screwing around...!
Joshua looks back in search of the parrot. He notices
several feathers floating down to the floor. He headsover to investigate. Joshua pulls the blanket clear toreveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside. Nosign of any tarantulas. Joshua checks the back side ofthe tank.

rap tune by NWA. Tres ’bizarre, non? Shampoo lather
cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She isoblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front ofher. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off thesoap.
Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather
builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed oncemore. The spider returns across its web right in frontof her eyes.
The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead
blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels nowater coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reachingwith eyes closed, she can ’t see the little spider has
landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, thespider scurries onto its opposite side.
Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the
washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it canstrike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth.
The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the

tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her.Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladysgrabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as shestumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burnerknobs, turning on the gas.
Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks
back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As shegoes, the tarantula fires a webline at her.
Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the
webline prevents her from slotting it home.
Gladys strains with all her might, finally slots the
fuse. She turns toward the kitchen just in time to seethe broken burner spark to life. The gas ignites. Thetarantula is engulfed in flame.
Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her
back when a second male tarantula nails her with awebline. Gladys screams as she ’s dragged across the
floor toward the basement door.
The fire grows more intense, spreading quickly.

at the fire for a beat. And then he charges toward theinferno. Sam tackles him from behind. Pinning him tothe ground.
CHRIS
No! Let me go! Gladys! Let mego!
The museum collapses. Chris watches it burn to the
ground.
EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)
The fire is out. The once-proud building is now a
smoldering pile of rubble. Locals stand in small groups.
Chris wanders through the ruins as firemen mop up. He
picks something out of the char. The map of the mines.Almost completely burned. Soaked with water. He staresat it for a heavy beat. All that remains of his legacy.Sam steps up.
SAM
Maybe she got out.
Sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.
CHRIS
(devastated)
She was cooking. The stove wasbroken.
SAM
Why don’t you come home with me?
We’ll get you cleaned up.
Chris hesitates for a moment. And then he lets the map
fall. He walks out of the ruins with Sam.
(CONTINUED)52.
CONTINUED:Mike stands off to the side. He spots something near the
edge of the ruins. He goes over to pick it up. It ’sa
piece of arachnid exoskeleton. A spider ’s leg. Big.
Very big. Travis the fire chief warns him away.
TRAVIS
Get away from there, Mike!
Mike hurries clear with his prize. He puts it on the
ground, sketches the outline of a spider to fit the scaleof the leg.
MIKE
Holy God...
Mike looks around for his mom. He sees her driving off
in the cop car with Chris.
MIKE
Mom! Wait!
EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DUSK
The sun hangs low in the sky. Sam ’s cop car parks beside
Bret’s monster truck.

with CPR. The doctor counts as he pumps the man ’s chest.
TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
One... two... three...
Ashley watches intently. The patient is revived.
TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
Helping people never gets old.
Ashley hears KEYS in the front DOOR. She quickly
switches channels to MTV. Sam enters with Chris.
SAM
Is Bret here?
ASHLEY
No.
SAM
Then why is his truck out front?
(CONTINUED)53.

ASHLEY
Don’t worry about it.
SAM
What do you mean? What happened?
ASHLEY
Nothing.
Ashley starts crying. Sam goes to comfort her daughter.
Chris stands by in shock. Watching, Upset.
ASHLEY
Nothing happened, alright!
Ashley runs off to her room. Sam follows.Chris stands alone for a beat. He walks to the kitchen
and pulls a bottle of Vodka from the freezer. He putsthe cold bottle against his head and neck. Trying tocool off.
Mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of
exoskeleton. He sees Chris opening the bottle of vodka.
MIKE
Spiders shed their skins when theygrow.
Chris looks at Mike for a moment.
MIKE
Like snakes.
CHRIS
Gladys is dead.
Chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle.
MIKE
Maybe not.
That got Chris ’s attention.
MIKE
This is a tarantula ’s leg. Or it
was. It ’s an exoskeleton, to be
scientific.
CHRIS
It’s a little large.
(CONTINUED)54.
CONTINUED:Chris has another gulp of vodka as Mike holds up his
Cassiopeia full of spider data. He shows Chris a videoof a male tarantula mummifying its food. Chris watchesin amazement.
MIKE
See! Male tarantulas wrap theirprey in webbing. Tight like amummy. The food stays alive sothey can eat it later.
Sam enters the room in time to overhear this.
SAM
Mike, please. Now isn ’t the time.
Chris looks up at Sam.
CHRIS
They keep their food alive.
Mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton.
SAM
What is this?
MIKE
A spider ’s leg!
Sam flinches, dropping the object to the floor.
MIKE
Careful!
SAM
No. That ’s a piece of cactus.
Look... It ’s covered with spines.
MIKE
Those are quills! Tarantulas canflick them at you like darts!
Mike does an odd flicking motion. Kind of like a dog
scratching a flea.
SAM
Giant tarantulas?
MIKE
Tarantulas! Wolfs! Trapdoors!Joshua had a ton of exotics!
(CONTINUED)55.

CHRIS
If there were giant spidersroaming the desert, don ’t you

Skis. Sam leads Chris to a bag full of her ex-husband ’s
clothes.
SAM
I guess I should watch more’Oprah.’It must be a textbook
’no-dad’kind of thing.
Chris shifts awkwardly. In shock. Sad. Sam holds up a
flannel shirt.
CHRIS
That one looks kind of scratchy.
Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it
and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt.
SAM
All Jason cared about was gettingout and starting over. I guessthat included buying a newwardrobe.
Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He ’s buttoning
up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn ’t
register Sam ogling his exposed chest.
(CONTINUED)56.
CONTINUED:
CHRIS
Gladys thought I should sell...but you know... I never wanted toget rich. If it was about themoney, I would have sold out toWade a long time ago.
Chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants.
CHRIS
I think I just wanted to prove thegold was down there. That myfamily wasn ’t crazy to keep
looking. Even after we ’d lost so
much. And now... she ’s gone, too.
SAM
I’m sorry, Chris.
CHRIS
Do you know what I ’m trying to
say?
SAM
It wasn’t about spending the gold,
it was about finding it.
CHRIS
That’s right. That ’s exactly
right.
Sam glimpses Chris through car windows. The poor guy ’s
struggling to pull on some 501s. Sam turns away, butcatches sight of him in a propped-up glass door.
CHRIS
Remind me never to let you do mylaundry.
She turns, only to see him in a mirror. He steps out
from behind the car. Sam stares at him.
SAM
They look great.

Mike checks the phone. Still dead. He types at his
computer, entering the specification of the piece ofexoskeleton. A digital representation of a spider growson his monitor screen. Showing Mike exactly how big thespider would be after shedding this skin. Mike isdistracted by the LOUD MUSIC coming from Ashley ’s room.
MIKE
Can’t you turn that down?!
INT. ASHLEY ’S ROOM - DUSK
MIKE (O.S.)
I’m doing spider research!
Ashley stops ripping. She goes to the pile of animals,
oblivious to the spider. The beast doesn ’t move. Ashley
grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. Shereturns to bed and cuts the bear ’s heart out with
scissors.
The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley. As it
moves, so does Ashley. She scoops up the torn photos andmutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. She turnsaround to find the giant spider on her bed. She freezesmomentarily.
ASHLEY
(sotto)
Spider... Mike... Spider...
Ashley sees her stun gun is on the dresser. She lunges
for it. She ’s almost got it. The spider squirts two
lines of gummy web at Ashley. The glop hits her int hechest, carries her backward. Glues her to the wall.
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

ASHLEY
Where are you going?

The chair is blown from his hand, and stuck to the wall.Chris stands weaponless before the spider.
ASHLEY

Sam takes a purposeful step back and launches a spinning
roundhouse kick that snaps the shotgun out of itsbinding. She grabs the bang stick and runs from theroom.

looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but thespitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flungacross the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve ofhis shirt. He shrugs out of it and makes another grabfor his scissors. He gets them.
MIKE
Get under it! Stab it in theabdomen! They don ’t have any
armor down there!
CHRIS
How am I supposed to do that!?
The spider leaps at Chris... and EXPLODES in midair.
Bits of gore shower Chris. He stands to see Sam in thedoor with her shotgun. Chris is covered in spider guts.
CHRIS
I’m gonna need some new pants.

Ashley is about to hyperventilate.
SAM
Calm down, baby.
ASHLEY
There aren ’t enough wine coolers

Harlan is at the top. Chris is a bit lower. The spiders
are still coming. Chris SHOOTS at them. His GUN RUNSDRY. He flips it around and butt-strokes an approachingarac.
A spider fires a web at Harlan. Nails the poor guy. And
drags him off the antenna.
Harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders.
Chris reaches out and grabs him. Holding Harlan ’s hand.
CHRIS
I’ve got you!
Harlan makes eye-contact with Chris. They ’re both about
to be killed unless...
HARLAN
Defend the human race!
CHRIS
No!
Harlan jerks away from Chris ’s hand. He cannonballs down
into the horde of spiders. Splattering several of thebeasts along with himself.
Chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac
and climbs even higher. He pulls out his machete andbegins hacking at the guide-wires that hold the antennaupright.
The spiders close in. Chris slices one wire. The
antenna quivers. Chris slices another wire. The antennashakes.

Sam looks up to see Chris come crashing down through the
skylight on the antenna. The antenna tilts in at a sixtydegree angle. Chris hangs off the end. Orb weavers ridetheir weblines down to the floor of the mall.
Mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym. He sees a
hundred spiders coming in on webs. Flooding out of thestores. The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere!
MIKE
Arac attack!
Chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web. He slides
down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at thebottom. Sam runs to his side.

ASHLEY
I can’t stay in here!
Ashley starts to move out of the tube. She discovers the
end has been covered with web. She pushes it. Somethingon the other side pushes back. Ashley scrambles back.Mike is already moving. The kids flee through the tubesto get away.
ASHLEY
What are they doing?
MIKE
(checks Cassiopeia)
They’re trapping us like ants in a
log! Once they have all the exitsblocked, they ’ll come in through
the last one!
They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a
spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfumegrenades at the spider, covering their retreat.
Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes.
Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers.
MIKE
We’ve gotta go!
Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide.
ASHLEY
Here!
She starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider
looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. Butit’s no use. At the last second Sam ’s boot kicks the
arachnid clear.78.
INT. MALL - NIGHTAshley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam
finish off the spider and then run with the kids.
Emma runs parallel to them across the playground ’s
sandbox. Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider.

tools. Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand.
HANK
It’s tool time!
Floyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his
chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungryspider descends on him from above and knocks him to thefloor.

NORMAN
You aren ’t going to arrest me for

SAM
Not today.
The group can hear SPIDERS BASHING at the upstairs door.
WADE
(to Norman)
Oh great! Now you ’ve trapped us!
Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs.
CHRIS
We should be able to hold them offfor a little while.
Suddenly a loud BANGING ERUPTS on the wall behind them.

CHRIS
We can get out this way!
ASHLEY
Aren’t the spiders in there?
MIKE
Not until daylight.
The BANGING on the upper door gets more INTENSE.Norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered
grow lights from his weed farm. He passes them out tothe group.
Chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the
mine shaft. Bret is shocked as the others follow him.The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.
BRET
You’re going back in there?! Are
you all crazy!?
WADE
Come on, Bret!
BRET
No way! I ’m not going!
Bret is alone in the room as the upper DOOR IMPLODES and
spiders flood downstairs. Bret dives through theopening.81.

What are you going to do?!
Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel ’s upper
support beam. More spiders come into the tunnel. SamFIRES desperately. Chris keeps on hacking.
SAM
Hurry!
Sam’s GUNS CLICK DRY. Spiders charge. Chris swings the
machete hard. The ROOF COLLAPSES onto the attackingspiders.
Chris and Sam leap back. Landing in a heap. Clouds of
dust swirl around them. They are tangled up for anawkward beat. Their faces just inches from each other...
SAM
Hold that thought.
They manage to disengage and move on.
INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT
Chris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few
remaining survivors.
WADE
We’re trapped again!
CHRIS
At least they can ’t follow us.
SAM
Which way do we go?
CHRIS
I think we ’re in one of the old
tunnels.
SAM
Can you get us out of here?
CHRIS
Don’t worry, Sam.
Chris takes point with the others following nervously.82.
INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHTA boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD
SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They fileinto a slightly more open area with two branchingtunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling withbarrels of toxic waste.
CHRIS
I don’t believe it...
Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the
barrel in the drainage ditch.
MIKE
I’ve seen one of these before!
ASHLEY
What are they?
CHRIS
Toxic waste.
SAM
Where did you see it, Mike?
MIKE
The creek where Joshua gets hisspider food. There was one in thewater.
Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.
CHRIS
We can get out this way!
BRET
No, we can ’t.
(turns to Wade)
Isn’t that tunnel blocked off,
Dad?
Chris and the others look at Wade.
WADE
Uh... yeah... he ’s right. We
can’t get out that way.
CHRIS
You did this?
WADE
I knew you ’d never sell... We ’re
under my property so...

CHRIS
We’re wasting time.
Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others
follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling afterthem.
INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT
Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across
bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbsruns along the roof into both tunnels.
CHRIS
One end of these lights should beconnected to a generator. That ’ll
be near the entrance.
They continue down the tunnel. Entering...
INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT
A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground.
Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches.
WADE

ASHLEY
Ewww... what ’s that smell?
The others are reacting strongly.

Methane. This cavern is full ofgas.
ASHLEY
What does that mean?
CHRIS
One spark and we ’re all dead.
Norman swallows his glowing joint.Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.
MIKE
That’s what I was talking about,
Chris. Presents from the maletarantula to the female.
BRET
So the female ’s around here?
Bret looks around nervously.The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a
horrifying sight. Joshua ’s corpse is a deflated flesh
balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull.He’s completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid
drained away.
Mike hides his eyes. Ashley comforts him.
SAM
That one just moved!
Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete. The
web comes away to reveal a human hand.
CHRIS
There’s somebody in here!
Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help.
They finally reveal Gladys.
CHRIS
Gladys!
The woman ’s body begins to spasm.
CHRIS
Gladys, please...
(to the others)
Can anybody help her?!
(CONTINUED)85.

ASHLEY
Her breathing is shallow. She ’s
going into arrest.
Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV.
Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.
CHRIS
It’s okay. It ’s okay.
Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris.
From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.
GLADYS
Am I... dead?
CHRIS
You’re okay.
GLADYS
I’m not in heaven?
CHRIS
No...
GLADYS
Then what ’s with all the gold?
Gladys points behind Chris ’s head to the wall of the
cavern. The group turns their lights on it. Thereflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross thecavern walls.
WADE
Gold! Gold! Look! It ’s
everywhere!
SAM
Is it real?
Chris checks it out.
CHRIS
Jesus... it ’s the mother lode...
He was right. My dad was right...
Chris helps Gladys to her feet. They share an emotional
look of recognition.
GLADYS
So were you.
(CONTINUED)86.

WADE
Get as much as you can!
Bret looks at Ashley.
BRET
Nice work, Doc.
Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade. Sam
puts her hand on Ashley ’s shoulder.
SAM
You saved my life.
Ashley smiles.Gladys leans over to Norman.
GLADYS
Have you got a smoke, kid?
NORMAN
The man says this cavern is fullof highly flammable methane gas.I smoke to get high, not to die.
SAM
Spiders!
The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas
scuttling out of the shadows.
NORMAN
What’s the big deal?
Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his
boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can.Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of thesquashed bodies.
MIKE
I think you should stop.
NORMAN
Why?
MIKE
They don ’t have hair. They aren ’t
fully grown tarantulas.
Chris and Sam look over.
(CONTINUED)87.
CONTINUED:
MIKE
They’re giant babies!
Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the
dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.
Chris reacts to the noise. He can guess what ’s coming...
The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela
has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By farthe largest spider we ’ve seen yet. Covered in hair.
Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.
Mike’s eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.
MIKE
Consuela.
CHRIS
Consuela?
The fur on Consuela ’s back seems to undulate. There is
something weird there. A lot of weird things. Infact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of babytarantulas.
As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized
quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stainspreads across the drug dealer ’s shirt.
NORMAN
Bummer...
Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him
tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper,chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.
CHRIS
Go!
The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern. A
male tarantula drops down to block their escape. SamBLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping awaybits of gold.
CHRIS
Leave it!
WADE
So you can keep it all!? Hell no!
Wade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a
nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly loomsbehind him.
(CONTINUED)88.
CONTINUED:
BRET
Dad!
Bret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for
him. Consuela ’s fangs suddenly protrude from Wade ’s
chest and he ’s hauled backward. The tarantula flings
Wade into the cave.
CHRIS
Bret, come on!
Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing
more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bretleaps into harm ’s way. He ’s turned into a pin cushion.
ASHLEY
Bret!
Ashley goes to his side.
BRET
I’m sorry I...
Bret dies. Sam drags Ashley away from him.
INT. MINES - NIGHT
The survivors flee along the tunnel. Chris jumps up to
rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling.
SAM
We have to get out!
CHRIS
This is our chance to kill themall.
Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand.
CHRIS
When the power comes on, the bulbwill ignite the methane and torchthem!
SAM
Where did you get an idea likethat!?
Chris looks at Gladys.
GLADYS
I blew up the kitchen.

SAM

CHRIS
Will be buried under tons of rock!Go!
SAM
What about you?
CHRIS
I need to set the fuse as close tothe spiders as I can. That shouldgive us time to get clear.
Sam and Chris share a brief beat. And then Chris pulls
down the lights, dragging them back toward thetarantula ’s den.
SAM
He has a cute butt. Don ’t you
think?
GLADYS
U.S.D.A. choice.

STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Samaccelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. Thebike’s headlight illuminates their path.
The male tarantula scurries after the bike.Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs
on tight. They ’ve put some distance between themselves
and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them.Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.

the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother ’s
shoulder at the giant spider coming in the oppositedirection.
ASHLEY
